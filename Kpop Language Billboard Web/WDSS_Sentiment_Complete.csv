Hey, what’s your dream?      
Hey, what's your dream?      
Hey, is that your dream?      
I wanna big house, big cars & big rings      
But in reality, I don't have any big dreams      
Haha I live an easy life      
Even if I don’t dream, no one says anything to me      
Everyone is thinking the same as me      
When we were still young I said I'll go to some university      
Okay, mum, I'm going to the library      
What is the you that you dreamed of?      
Who do you see in your mirror, I gotta say      
Go your own way      
Even if you live a day      
Do something      
Put weakness away      
Why don't you say anything? You don't want to study      
You're too afraid to quit the school, right? See, you're getting ready for school      
Grow up, don't just talk, You have a glass mentality, boy      
(Stop!) Ask yourself, when did you try hard      
Hey, what’s your dream?      
Hey, what’s your dream?      
Hey, what's your dream?      
Hey, is that your dream?      
It’s a lie, you such a liar

Why are you telling me to go another way? Do well yourself!      
Please don't force me

What's you dream? What’s your dream?      
(La la la la la)      
Is that your dream? Is that your dream?      
Boring same day, every day repeats      
Adults and parents tell us the same dream      
Future job number one, public officials?      
It's not a forced dream, a relief pitcher      
Throw a fastball to the self-study time that is a waste of time      
Disobey the hell-like society pardon the dream      
Ask yourself 'bout the profile of your dream      
Become the subject of your own life, away from suppression      
What is the you that you dreamed of?      
Who do you see in your mirror, I gotta say      
Go your own way      
Even if you live a day

All you little kids go to the corner      
I’m the sommelier who will change your taste      
Blow on it when it’s hot      
I’ll throw this one to you, bow your head in thanks, hurray      
Hey mister and sister, I’m TOP, the real one is coming      
Blow on it while it’s hot      
When I rap, it’s so hot      
It hasn’t been that long      
What to do with this burnt smell      
You with the sleeping cells      
Have you seen the last weapon?      
The thin eardrums of the sleeping soul      
I’ll poke it with a thorn, make it burn      
You with the sleeping cells      
I’ll poke it with a thorn, make it burn

I’m a 21st century, extraordinary Korean      
A god-given rap Basquait with a mic      
I’m warming up my mouth for the first time in a while, I’ll be done in just one song      
I’ll make you go crazy but I’m like a clear pinot noir      
I don’t care if your bones melt, let’s see the end to this madness      
Just like that, just like this, let’s look at a new world      
Point your gun to the complicated world, to the noisy sounds and bang bang bang      
Let out your heaving breath and DOOM DA DA DIVI DA      
Ga na da ra ma ba sa      
Ah ja cha ka ta pa, God protect and preserve us      
It feels like I’m looking above the universe, I’m a fearless dreamer

I’m so hungry for your love      
I want to be your oppa      
I’ll have you, just watch      
Why are you shaking up my heart?      
Why are you shaking up my heart?      
Why are you shaking up my heart?      
Shaking up      
Shaking up      
(Dad) Just how exactly      
Did dad ask mom out?      
Should I write you a letter?      
What is this? I become like dust in front of you      
You make me so angry and mad for no reason      
I’m serious but you make me into a loser, who picks fights with you      
Why do I care so much about you?      
You’re making a big boy act like a little kid      
But, I’m going to flip the situation, from friends to lovers      
If it’s with you, I think I can go to a good college      
ABCDEFGH Hakuna Matata      
Your profile picture is the same but why do I keep checking it?      
But don’t misunderstand, I’m not an easy guy      
I’m getting nervous, I’m getting nervous      
Who are you? Are you that great?      
Why do you keep teasing me?      
Just stop now, hold up, hold up      
Hold me tight before I kiss you      
Before my heart lets you go      
Say what you want      
Say what you want      
What is it that you really want?      
Hold me tight before I kiss you      
Before my heart lets you go      
Say what you want      
Say what you want

What do I do? I think I m broken, I forgot even how to breathe

넌 내 하나뿐인 태양 세상에 딱 하나      
널 향해 피었지만 난 자꾸 목말라      
너무 늦었어 늦었어 너 없이 살 순 없어      
가지가 말라도 더 힘껏 손을 뻗어      
손 뻗어봤자 금세 깨버릴 꿈 꿈 꿈      
미칠 듯 달려도 또 제자리일 뿐 뿐 뿐      
그냥 날 태워줘 그래 더 밀쳐내줘      
이건 사랑에 미친 멍청이의 뜀박질      
더 뛰게 해줘      
나를 더 뛰게 해줘      
두 발에 상처만 가득해도      
니 얼굴만 보면 웃는 나니까      
다시 Run Run Run 난 멈출 수가 없어      
또 Run Run Run 난 어쩔 수가 없어      
어차피 이것밖에 난 못해      
너를 사랑하는 것 밖엔 못해      
다시 Run Run Run 넘어져도 괜찮아      
또 Run Run Run 좀 다쳐도 괜찮아

추억들이 마른 꽃잎처럼      
산산이 부서져가      
내 손 끝에서 내 발 밑에서      
달려가는 네 등 뒤로      
마치 나비를 쫓듯 꿈 속을 헤매듯      
너의 흔적을 따라가      
길을 알려줘 날 좀 멈춰줘      
날 숨쉬게 해줘

Don't tell me bye bye","You’re my sun, the one and only in this world      
I bloom for you, but you make me thirsty      
It’s too late, too late      
I can’t live without you      
Even if I‘m drying out, I try harder to reach you      
But it’s no use, it’s a dream to be broken      
I run and run, but I’m not getting anywhere      
Just burn me out, yes      
Keep pushing me away      
This is a fool, crazy in love, chasing in circles      
Make me run      
Make me run more      
Let my feet rip apart with wounds      
At least I can smile when I see you

Everyone says it’s over, but I can’t stop      
Is this sweat or tears, I can’t really tell oh      
My love stripped bare, the stormy winds      
They make me run again, my heart beats again      
Make me run      
Make me run more      
Let my feet rip apart with wounds      
At least I can I smile when I see you

Pitiful destiny, point your finger at me      
Memories crumble like dried flower petals      
At the tip of my fingers, under my feet      
Right behind your back      
I’m chasing butterflies, so lost in dreams      
I follow your traces      
Show me the way, please stop me      
Let me breathe

I get mixed feelings as I breathe out      
Did I make any mistakes today      
How did the audience seem      
I’m happy with who I’ve become      
That I can make someone scream with joy      
Still excited from the performance      
I stand on the empty stage while holding onto an aftertaste that will not linger for long      
While standing on this empty stage, I become afraid of this unpleasant emptiness      
Within my suffocating feelings      
On top of my life’s line      
Without a reason, I forcibly act that I am fine      
This isn’t the first time, I better get used to it      
I try to hide it, but I can’t      
When the heat of the show cools down      
I leave the empty seats behind      
Trying to comfort myself      
I tell myself the world can’t be perfect      
I start to let myself go      
The thundering applause, I can’t own it forever      
I tell myself, so shameless      
Raise your voice higher      
Even if the attention isn’t forever, I’ll keep singing

그래 밉다 니가, 넌 떠났지만      
단 하루도 너를, 잊은 적이 없었지 난      
솔직히, 보고 싶은데, 이만 너를 지울게      
그게 널 원망하기보단 덜 아프니까

'Cause it hurts less than to blame you      
I try to exhale you in pain      
Like smoke, like white smoke

난 지금 어디로 쉬지않고 흘러가는가

雪積もるように 確かめているよ      
君がくれたもの 生きてく勇気      
Ay, あらゆる時間　越えて出逢ったんだ      
それで How do we do？果たせる？      
この不確か状態 Love      
思ったより　世界は早くて      
How we gonna change it？      
We don't know yet      
でもきっと      
(Eh) 愛、僕らの胸に uh yeah      
Slowly響きだして      
君を抱き締めたい 消えてしまう前に もう一度      
Ah どこまでも 舞い上がる Crystal      
ねぇ何もいらないから　もう少しだけ 感じてたい      
Can I touch your heart？      
触れたくても　すり抜けていく      
Oh someday? Someday...      
小さな笑顔が なぜか苦しい      
How can I be closer uh?      
この想いは何故 答えが出ない      
How I am gonna find it？      
どうやって？      
Oh let me know      
曖昧な形ばかり Crystal Snow      
報われない Story なんて もうムリ      
Eh この手で変えてみせるのに      
(Eh) Surely 誓えるのに      
君を守りたくて 涙に変わる前に もう一度      
願う程に 届かない Crystal      
100年先になっても 次の一歩は君とがいい      
Can I be your one      
星ひとつない雪の夜空      
Oh someday? Someday...      
もう二人は遥か遠い      
一つのはずなのに      
今では僕らを      
彩る絵の具など      
選べやしない黒い息も      
深い君の白い霧も      
I feel, I feel, I feel, I feel (oh yeah)      
Oh crystal snow, crystal snow      
真っ白なその中で      
君が僕を通り過ぎ (yeah) 水になろうと胸でまだ流れてる (yeah)      
(奏でてる)      
輝くもの全てに映る      
光る君を見つめてる      
待ってるさまたどこでも      
会いたい嘘でも　握ってこの手を      
愛する温度が 溶け出す メロディ      
確かな 温もりよ 永遠(とわ)に続け      
君を抱き締めたい 消えてしまう前に もう一度      
叶えるため 舞い上がる Crystal      
ねぇ言葉足りないけど ありのままでも伝えるから      
Can I touch your heart      
信じて欲しい 迎えに行くよ      
Someday, Someday...      
It's always you, It's always you, crystal snow      
(Let me see your smile,oh baby, eh)      
It's always you, It's always you, crystal snow      
(Let me feel your love,そう どこまでも Fuu)      
It's always you, It's always you, crystal snow      
(Let me feel your love, our crystal snow yeah)      
It's always you, It's always you, crystal snow      
Oh yeah      
Crystal snow, oh, ohh      
どこまでも Baby crystal snow","Like snow piles up, I remember what you gave me      
You gave me the courage to live      
We met each other beyond all time      
So now how do we do? Can we make it work?      
This fragile love      
The world moves faster than we thought      
How we gonna change it?      
We don’t know yet but for sure we will      
(Eh) Love in our hearts, uh yeah      
(Eh) slowly started to grow      
I want to hold you one more time before you disappear      
Ah, crystal flies high wherever it goes      
Hey, there’s nothing else I want, I just want to feel a little more      
Can I touch your heart？      
I want to touch it but it keeps slipping through my fingers, someday, someday      
Your little smile somehow hurts me      
How can I be closer uh uh?      
Why can’t I find an answer for this love?      
How am I gonna find it? How?      
Oh, let me know      
Crystal snow only holds an ambiguous shape      
I can't bear my story of unrequited love      
Eh I’ll manage to change it on my own      
(Eh) surely, I can promise you      
I want to protect you one more time before tears run down your face      
But crystal gets further from reach, the more I wish for it      
Even after hundred years, I want to live with you      
Can I be your one?      
There is no single star in this snowy sky, oh, someday, someday      
The two of us are already far apart      
Even though we are meant to be together      
Now we can't choose the paint that colors us      
Even the black breath      
Even your thick white fog      
I feel, I feel, I feel, I feel      
Oh yeah, oh, crystal snow, crystal snow      
Inside the white fog      
Even though you pass through me and turn to water, you are still in my heart      
(You are in my heart)      
I watch you shining and reflecting on every single sparkling thing      
I’ll wait for you no matter where      
I want to see you, even if you're pretending, please hold this hand      
The warmth of love started melting      
This genuine warmth, please stay forever      
I want to hold you one more time before you disappear      
Crystal flies high to reach you      
Hey, words aren't enough to express my feelings but I will tell you as it is      
Can I touch your heart?      
I want you to believe me, I’ll come get you      
Someday, someday      
It’s always you, it’s always you, crystal snow      
(Let me see your smile, oh baby, eh)      
It’s always you, it’s always you, crystal snow      
(Let me feel your love forever, hoo)      
It’s always you, it’s always you, crystal snow      
(Let me feel your love, our crystal snow yeah)      
It’s always you, it’s always you, crystal snow

What is love?      
Every day, in a movie      
In a book or in a drama, I feel love      
Um- I learn about love      
My heart keeps beating as if it's my own story      
Makes my heart pound and swell with hope      
Um- I want to know so bad      
Ooh, maybe someday      
Could it happen to me too?      
When will it be? Who will it be?      
(I wanna know) How it could be as sweet as candy?      
(I wanna know) How it's like flying in the sky?      
I wanna know know know know      
What is love?      
What love feels like?      
(I wanna know) How it keeps you smiling all day?      
(I wanna know) How the whole world turns beautiful?      
I wanna know know know know      
What is love?      
Will love come to me someday?      
Just imagining all of this      
Just thinking about it      
Almost makes my heart burst      
Um- How good it feels?      
If, one day, for real      
Love does comes to me, I might just cry      
Um- I really want to know how it feels      
Ooh, maybe someday      
Could it happen to me too?      
When will it be? Who will it be?      
(I wanna know) How it could be as sweet as candy?      
(I wanna know) How it's like flying in the sky?      
I wanna know know know know      
What is love?

(I wanna know) How the whole world turns beautiful?      
I wanna know know know know      
What is love?      
Will love come to me someday?      
Where in the world are you right now?      
Just when will we get to meet each other?      
When and how might our relationship start?      
I don't know right now, but somehow I feel      
That it will be really good      
Better than any movie or drama      
The greatest love will come      
My gut instinct is always right      
C'mon, show yourself, i'm all set, Ready!      
(wonder where you are) I'm gonna find you      
(wonder where you are) I'm so dying to see you      
I can't take it much longer      
How it could be as sweet as candy?      
How it's like flying in the sky?

피어있는 이 garden      
가시투성이      
이 모래성에 난 날 매었어      
너의 이름은 뭔지      
갈 곳이 있긴 한지      
Oh could you tell me?      
이 정원에 숨어든 널 봤어      
And I know      
너의 온긴 모두 다 진짜란 걸      
푸른 꽃을 꺾는 손      
잡고 싶지만      
내 운명인 걸      
Don't smile to me      
Light on me      
너에게 다가설 수 없으니까      
내겐 불러줄 이름이 없어      
You know that I can't      
Show you me      
Give you me      
초라한 모습 보여줄 순 없어      
또 가면을 쓰고 널 만나러 가      
But I still want you      
외로움의 정원에 핀      
너를 닮은 꽃      
주고 싶었지      
바보 같은 가면을 벗고서      
But I know      
영원히 그럴 수는 없는 걸      
숨어야만 하는 걸      
추한 나니까      
난 두려운 걸      
초라해      
I’m so afraid      
결국엔 너도 날 또 떠나버릴까      
또 가면을 쓰고 널 만나러 가      
할 수 있는 건      
정원에      
이 세상에      
예쁜 너를 닮은 꽃을 피운 다음      
니가 아는 나로 숨쉬는 것      
But I still want you      
I still want you      
어쩌면 그때      
조금만      
이만큼만      
용길 내서 너의 앞에 섰더라면      
지금 모든 건 달라졌을까      
난 울고 있어      
사라진      
무너진      
홀로 남겨진 이 모래성에서      
부서진 가면을 바라보면서      
And I still want you      
But I still want you      
But I still want you      
But I still want you","Full of loneliness      
This garden bloomed      
Full of thorns      
I bind myself in this sand castle      
What is your name      
Do you have a place to go      
Oh could you tell me?      
I saw you hiding in this garden      
And I know      
All of your warmth is real      
The blue flower your hand was picking      
I want to hold it but      
It’s my fate      
Don’t smile to me      
Light on me      
Because I can’t get closer to you      
There’s no name you can call me      
You know that I can’t      
Show you me      
Give you me      
I can’t show you a ruined part of myself      
Once again I put a mask on and go to see you      
But I still want you      
Bloomed in a garden of loneliness      
A flower that resembles you      
I wanted to give it to you      
After I take off this foolish mask      
But I know      
I can't do that forever      
I have to hide      
Because I'm a monster      
I am afraid      
I am shattered      
I’m so afraid      
That you will leave me again in the end      
Once again I put on a mask and go to see you      
The only thing I can do      
In the garden      
In this world      
Is to bloom a pretty flower that resembles you      
And to breathe as the me that you know      
But I still want you      
I still want you      
Maybe back then      
A little      
Just this much      
If I had the courage to stand before you      
Would everything be different now      
I'm crying      
That’s disappeared      
That’s fallen      
Left alone in this sandcastle      
Looking at this broken mask      
And I still want you

무언가 깨지는 소리      
난 문득 잠에서 깨      
낮설음 가득한 소리      
귀를 막아 보지만 잠엘 들지 못해      
목이 자꾸 아파와      
감싸 보려하지만      
나에겐 목소리가      
없어 오늘도 그 소릴 들어      
또 울리고있어 그 소리가      
이얼어 붙은 호수에 또 금이 가      
그 호수에 내가 날 버렸 잖아      
내 목소릴 널 위해 묻었 잖아      
날 버린 겨울 호수 위로      
두꺼운 얼음이 얼었네      
잠시 들어간 꿈 속에도      
나를 괴롭히는 환상 통은 여전해 (Mmh)      
나는 날 잃은 걸까      
아님 널 잃은 걸까      
나 문득 호수로 달려가      
오그 속에 내 얼굴 있어      
부탁해 아무 말도하지 마      
입을 막으려 손을 뻗어 보지만      
보지만 결국 엔 언젠가 봄이와      
얼음들은 녹아 내려 흘러 가      
Tell me 내 목소리가 가짜라면 (Oh)      
날 버리지 말았어야했는지 (Oh, no)      
Tell me 고통조차 가짜라면 (Oh)      
그 때 내가 무얼해야했는지","A sound of something breaking      
I awake from sleep      
A sound full of unfamiliarity      
Try to cover my ears but can’t go to sleep      
The pain in my throat gets worse      
Try to cover it      
I don’t have a voice      
Today I hear that sound again      
It’s ringing again, that sound      
A crack again on this frozen lake      
I dumped myself into the lake      
I buried my voice for you      
Over the winter lake I was thrown      
A thick ice has formed atop      
A winter lake on which I was thrown away      
A thick ice has formed      
In the dream I shortly went into      
My agonizing phantom pain is still the same      
Have I lost myself      
Or have I gained you      
I suddenly run to the lake      
There’s my face in it      
Please don't say anything      
Reach my hand out to cover the mouth      
But in the end, spring will come someday      
The ice will melt and flow away      
Tell me if my voice isn't real      
If I shouldn’t have thrown myself away      
Tell me if even this pain isn’t real

FATHER FIGURE!","You make me feel special      
There are one of those days      
Days when I suddenly feel all alone      
When I feel like I don’t belong anywhere      
And my head is hanging down      
Whenever those days come, you tell me      
How precious I am      
All those words you say      
Everything’s alright      
From nobody to somebody      
I become a very special me      
You make me feel special      
No matter how the world brings me down      
Even when hurtful words stab me      
I smile again 'cause you’re there      
That’s what you do      
Again, I feel special      
One moment I feel like I’m nothing at all      
Like no one would notice if I were gone      
But then when I hear you calling me      
I feel loved, I feel so special      
I just wanted to hide      
Didn’t wanna face the world      
As if everything has lost meaning      
As if I have lost meaning      
I just sat there still      
Then you appeared before me      
With a warm smile, you held out your hand

From nobody to somebody

You are indeed my shining light

Geum-nam Chung-jang Street, that’s my Harlem      
Joined NEURON, bounce with my team, ayy      
Went head over heels for dancing, workaholic, everyday      
As a teen, grew up pulling all-nighters, that’s the case      
My height is measured by dance, I’m okay      
A grand vision, a plan I'm going on to draw      
A kid who goes on to shape his dream      
Steps stomping over the rhythm      
Popping, rocking, hopping, tutting, dougie, flexing, swaggin' (Woah)      
Still do the work everyday, ASAP, for my own sake (Woah)

Shining brighter than ever before      
Do you see me right now

The only wish in my heart      
The confession that came true      
Heart fluttering, as if dreaming      
Unable to sleep for long, staying awake      
Every night I dreamed of only you      
With each step, nervously heading towards you

I'd grow ever so small but then      
A tad closer towards you

Call us fall guys surprise, just like a jackbox 
T-Spin s for Tat Mok, drop in and they re droppin like flies 
But you still haven t planted the spike 
Turn a stirge to ash cause I can 
Catch me brawling with these cantrips, can t trip me say ike 
Butter and gold, you already know, fly like an Elytra that's Durag Mode 
Tango with a stirge queen My queen 
Gnoelani payback scene 
Chadzznor s mean shirtless gleam 
Dirk s shot not looking clean Oof 
Bottom frag like Reiny is in quiplash 
Quick cash making when faking it in Fibbage 
Seriously, these hops they murder like it s jump kill Fuck you 
Alien spill, push the button or else we will run out of 
Time to play the game with the tabletop goblin 
The overseer decides your fate when you drop in 
Pop in the dice, the vice that strikes twice 
Roll bad and the price might be your life Nat- 
Shrieking bawls of the Thralls rising up with night fall 
Light the pitch black dark up with a bright fireball 
Making the wrong step might end with a free fall 
The plight and demise being end-all, be-all 
Slay the monsters, the impossible we conquer 
Embark on expeditions like the great Alexander 
Defiant disposition it s a suicide mission 
But we keep riding, we on a collision course 
Yasuo crits, hit you with them autumn-atic 
Call us fall guys, surprise, just like a jackbox

Rappin maths with a flow so fast mathematicians stop and call it logarithmic 
Fields Medal winning bars so hot I get stopped on the street get asked for a quick pic Yeah! 
Change the rap game then I change my rap name to ln cause I m a natural Too easy 
Proofs on the paper so check my solutions cause that s how you know its factual That's true

A universal constant around since creation Creation?

But I still want to hold onto it, wherever you are I’ll find you      
To a tomorrow of us      
Even it seems to be the beginning of the end      
I’ll call your name      
The gazing eyes are so colorful      
I'll give my everything to you      
Still unable to verbalize the hopeless dream in my heart      
To face the past and the future      
How much hope is needed to reach you      
It's nights like these that I keep on thinking      
In the city at dusk      
To be loved, to love someone, I’ll become your eye      
For the adventure that lies ahead      
Even the darkness we see is so beautiful      
Please believe me      
Looking only directly at you      
So you don't go away      
The gazing eyes are so colorful      
You taught me      
That someday the sadness will wind us together

I guess everyone's happy

The meaning of the tears reflected in the mirror      
My color hidden with a smile, blue and grey      
I don't know where it went wrong

Maybе that's why I've been living so fiercely      
But whеn I look back, I'm all by myself      
That hazy shadow that swallows me up

Is it anxiety or depression?      
How am I so regretful?

I still don't know, the ferocious blue

널 본 것 같아      
눈뜨면 다시
