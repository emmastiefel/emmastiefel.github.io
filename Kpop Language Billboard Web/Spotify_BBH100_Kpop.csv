Smoke like a broke stove 
Don't quit, take flight 
I can't remember last night

Sci-fi with that boy trooping hard, couping cars 
Snoop be hard in the paint 
Drink another cup until I fall flat 
All lead and then some 
1-5-1, done dilly 
Really for sure that 
I'm throw back intoxicated 
Change over, game over, hangover, faded 
Body shit miss 
where are you,  
can’t find you 
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe catch a lady by the toe

향한 거야

날 위했던 게 아닌 되려 너를 위한 거란 걸 
안다면 주저 말고 please save my life

Without any warning

Showed up not even a minute late

Still won't stop 
Running faster than that cloud of rain

The end of the day 
Someone come and save me, please 
A weary sigh of a tiring day 
I guess everyone's happy 
Can you look at me? 'Cause I am blue and grey 
The meaning of the tears reflected in the mirror 
My color hidden with a smile, blue and grey 
I don't know where it went wrong 
Since my youth, I've had a blue question mark in my head 
Maybе that's why I've been living so fiercely 
But whеn I look back, I'm all by myself 
That hazy shadow that swallows me up 
The blue question mark still exists 
Is it anxiety or depression? 
How am I so regretful? 
Or is it just me, one that loneliness gave birth to 
I still don't know, the ferocious blue 
I hope I don't erode away, I'll find the exit 
I just wanna be happier 
To melt the cold me 
My hands have reached out countless times

The sound of my fast heartbeat breathing 
I still feel it 
Don't say it's okay 
'Cause it's not okay 
Please don't leave me alone, it hurts too much 
On the road I always walk 
There is a light that always shines 
But today, the scene feels unfamiliar 
Is it dull or is it broken? 
This lump of metal feels heavy 
A grey rhino is approaching 
I'm just standing there without focus 
I don't feel like myself at this moment 
I'm just not scared 
I don't believe in a God called conviction 
Words like color make me cringe 
A vast grey area is way more comfortable 
Hundreds of millions of grey facial expressions here 
When it rains, it's my world 
I dance over this city 
On a clear day, bring some fog 
On rainy days, we're always together 
A toast to all the dust here

They're not warm, so I need you more

24 hours 시간 참 많아 
하루 종일 잠자도 지금은 no problem 
몸 부서져라 뭘 해야 할 거 같은데 
마냥 삼시 세끼 다 먹는 나란 새끼 
내 죄, 쉬는 내 자신을 물어뜯는 개 
Don’t do that 외쳐봐도 성과에 목매 매일 
E'r'yday do my thang, damn if I fail 
계속 으르렁대 썩은 동아줄을 tap 
불안전해 이건 병 
물리적인 건 직업이 주는 stun, ow! 
Maybe 
내가 아파서 그래 생각이 많은 탓 
I hate that 
단순하지 못한 치기 어린 나 
나도 참 어려 몸만 어른 
절뚝거려 인생 걸음 
One for the laugh 
Two for the show 
Just like I'm so fine 
Everyday 나를 위로해 
다 똑같은 사람이야 ain't so special 
Ayy, man keep one, two step 
차분하게 모두 치료해보자고 
나의 병 
벼벼벼벼병 
버려 겁 
거거거거겁 
RM, yeah 
마음에도 방학이 필요해 
아 그냥 일은 일로 해 
I'm ill, 그래 내가 일 그 자체 
쉼이란 친구 oh, I never liked him 
얼마를 벌어야 행복하겠니? 
이 유리 같은 병이 때리지 니 머리 
병든 게 세상인지 난지 헷갈려 
안경을 벗어도 어둠은 안 흐릿해져 
이 시간 뒤에 어떤 라벨이 붙건 
부디 그게 전부 너길 바래 
너의 너, 너 
다들 병들이 많아 내가 헷갈리는 건 
인간이란 본디 추악함을 가진다는 것 
마음의 병의 가짓수들만 400개가 더 
되는데 해당 안 되는 자 거 별로 없단 것 
Yo 병든 게 세상인지 나인지 
단순히 바라보는 해석들의 차인지 
그게 다인지 
I don't know 누군가를 바꿔보는 것 
그것보다 빠른 것은 내가 변화하는 것 
Maybe 
내가 아파서 그래 생각이 많은 탓 
I hate that 
단순하지 못한 치기 어린 나 
나도 참 어려 몸만 어른

Sick and tired 
But I don’t wanna mess up 
'Cause life goes on 
Through the fire 
걸어갈게 더 나답게, woah 
Walk it, walk it, walk it 
밤이 되면 내 두 눈 감고서 
Walk it, walk it, walk it 
내가 알던 날 다시 믿을래 
자 일어나 one more time 
다시 아침이야 오늘을 나야 해 
가보자고 one more night 
이 끝에 뭐가 있을지 몰라, ayy 
Woo 영원한 밤은 없어 
난 강해졌어 
불꽃이 터져 
I will never fade away 
Everyday 나를 위로해

Uh, it looks like I lost something 
I relieve anxiety with a sip of coffee 
An endless rest 
Uncomfortable happiness that suddenly came to me 
24 hours, we have a lot of time 
I sleep all day, now there's no problem 
Break down, what should we do? 
I'm the one who eats three meals a day 
My sin, a dog biting me while I rest 
Don't do that 
Even if I scream, I'm hungry for achievements every day 
E'r'yday do my thang, damn if I fail 
I keep growling, a rotten rope 
It's unsafe, this is a disease 
That job gives you a physical stun, ow! 
Maybе 
It's because I'm sick 
Becausе of my many thoughts 
I hate that 
I'm not so simple 
I'm too young, my body's the only grown up 
The limp of life 
One for the laugh 
Two for the show 
Just like I'm so fine 
Everyday I comfort myself 
They're all the same, ain't so special 
Ayy, man keep one, two step

My disease 
Dis-dis-dis-disease 
Scare away 
This cowardice 
RM, yeah 
My heart needs a vacation 
Oh, just do your job 
I'm ill, yeah, I'm the job itself 
A friend named ""rest"" oh, I never liked him 
How much do you have to earn to be happy? 
This hits your head like a glass bottle 
I don't know if it's the world that's sick 
The dark doesn't blur out even when I take off my glasses 
Whatever label is attached to me after this time 
I hope that's all you 
You, you, you 
Everybody's got a lot of diseases, I'm confused by that 
That humankind is inherently disgusting 
400 more cases of heart disease 
There aren't many people that don't work 
Yo, is it the world or me that's sick? 
Is it just a difference in interpretation? 
I don't know if that's all 
I don't know how to change someone 
Something faster than that is me changing 
Maybe 
It's because I'm sick 
Because of my many thoughts 
I hate that

'Cause life goes on 
Through the fire 
I'll walk more like myself, woah 
(Walk it, walk it, walk it) 
When night falls, I close my eyes 
(Walk it, walk it, walk it) 
I wanna trust in the day you knew 
Now wake up one more time 
It's morning again, I have to take it today 
Let's go, one more night 
I don't know what's at the end, ayy 
Woo, there's no eternal night 
I'm stronger 
A spark of fire 
I will never fade away
