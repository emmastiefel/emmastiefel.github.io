Intro: Persona,Map of the Soul : 7,2/21/2020,"“Who am I,” a question that I’ve been asking myself for my whole life 
A question that I will probably never be able to find the right answer for 
If I were answerable with only a few words,  
God wouldn’t have created all those various beauties
 
How you feel? How are you feeling right now? 
Actually, I’m really good, but it’s a little uncomfortable  
I’m still not sure if I’m a dog, a pig, or whatever,
 Am I Wrong translation
 
but then others come and put a pearl necklace on me, ptui!
 
At least I laugh more than before 
A superhero that I wished to be, 
now it feels like I really became one 
But why is there more and more blabbering  
One says “run,” and another says “stop” 
This one says “look at the forest,” and that one says “look at the wildflower” 
My shadow, I named him “hesitation” and called him so 
Once he became it, he has never hesitated 
Whether it is under the stage or under the light, he keeps appearing  
and stares at me fiercely like heat haze (Oh shit) 
Hey, have you already forgotten why you started this? 
You were just loving it that there’s someone listening to you 
Sometimes, everything feels like total nonsense 
You know what comes out of you when you’re drunk, it’s like acting silly 
Someone like me isn’t good enough for (doing) music 
Someone like me isn’t good enough for (delivering) the truth 
Someone like me isn’t good enough for (answering) the calling 
Someone like me isn’t good enough to be a muse 
My flaws that I know, maybe those are really all I’ve got 
The world is actually not interested at all in my clumsiness 
When I tossed and tumbled every night with the regrets that I don’t even get sick of anymore 
and twisted the irreversible time like a habit, 
it was the first question that raised me to stand up every time 
‘But,’ the word that should come before the three syllables of my name
 
So I’m askin’ once again yeah 
Who the hell am I? 
Tell me all your names baby 
Do you wanna die? 
Oh do you wanna go? 
Do you wanna fly? 
Where’s your soul? Where’s your dream? 
Do you think you’re alive? 
(How about you?) 
(I don’t know, man) 
(But I know one thing) 
Yeah my name is R
 
The ‘me’ who I remember and who people know 
The ‘me’ who I created by myself to speak my mind 
Yeah, I might have been deceiving myself, I might have been lying 
But, I’m not ashamed of it, t 
his is the map of my soul 
Dear myself 
You must never lose your temperature 
because you don’t need to be warm or cold 
Though I might sometimes pretend I’m good and sometimes pretend I’m evil,
 
this is the barometer of my direction that I want to set
 
The ‘me’ who I want to be
 
The ‘me’ who people want 
The ‘me’ who I love  
And the ‘me’ who I craft 
The ‘me’ who’s smiling 
The ‘me’ who’s crying sometimes 
Living and breathing every second, every moment, even now, 
Persona
 
Who the hell am I? 
I just wanna go 
I just wanna fly 
I just wanna give you all the voices till I die 
I just wanna give you all the shoulders when you cry

I just wanna give you all the voices till I die 
I just wanna give you all the shoulders when you 
Cry","Beauties = different “I”s, different personas 
As explained in 
, “a dog or a pig” is used in a sarcastic manner since it is a term used to belittle the general public. 
Reference: “casting pearls before swine.”
RM doesn’t know what he is and then others come and put a pearl necklace on him (who could be “a pig”) and treat him as someone pearl-worthy, making him uncomfortable. 
Wordplay: 보라 하다 is “to say to see,” where 보라 comes from 보다 (to see). However, with 보라 as a noun meaning purple, 보라하다 (to purple) is used by BTS and their fans as “to love.” The above line, therefore, can be “this one loves forests, and that one loves wildflowers.” 
Note: Although “shadow” here is the shadow in Jungian psychology, the above four lines reminded me of his interview at the beginning of 2018. He calls his anxiety his shadow. It grew as his height grew, and it grows at night. He also acknowledges and accepts that the shadow will follow him wherever he goes and whatever he does, and therefore tries to become friends with his shadow rather than separating himself from it.  (Translation of the full interview is available here.) 

 
(From here, it’s his shadow talking.) 
Wordplay: 취기 (chwigi; 醉氣)  is intoxication or tipsiness and 치기 (chigi; 稚氣) means childishness, immaturity, or foolishness. When you get drunk, you get tipsy and act like a child. 
소명 (somyoung; calling, mission) here can be a religious calling or a great mission. 
I’ve seen many people speculating that he is aware of and is using the “but Namjoon- ” thing. I personally strongly doubt if that’s the case since (1) it is almost strictly used in non-Korean (language-wise) fandoms, especially on “stan Twitter,” and (2) it doesn’t really work within the context anyway.
My interpretation of this line (again, this is my personal interpretation) is that this really is about his fundamental question, the question he’s been asking himself for his entire life and is still trying to figure out the answer (if there is one) for, the question that pops up every time he agonizes and regrets, and the question that really penetrates through the entire song. “But, who am I?” “But, (who is) Kim Namjoon?” 
(1) The letter R embraces all his rapper-selves: Runch Randa (his stage name as an underground rapper), Rap Monster (his stage name from 2013 to late 2017), and RM (late 2017 to now). It also connects to the lyrics of Answer: Love Yourself: “Y 
esterday’s me, today’s me, tomorrow’s me. Without exception, altogether, they are all me.”
(2) From “Voice” (the first track of his first mixtape): “Yeah, I be real. This moment, the thing that I wanted desperately. I’m finally oiling the pedals that I’ve been stepping on for seven years. You can’t kill. Come take it if you do want a piece of me. I only speak through music, I have no interest in anything else. If you really think you ready to fly with my power. This is what R is about, fella the time is now.” 
Notice how he acknowledges the possibility between warm and cold and between good and evil, which is a repeating concept from Love Yourself era. 

 
Note (not sure he meant this but): 척도 (cheokdo; barometer, criterion) can be separated into 척 and 도. 척 alone, placed after adjectives, makes “pretend to be ~,” and 도 is a postposition that used when listing similar things. Both go well with the previous line in terms of meaning and rhyme.  
It can also be “I who want to be me,” although the one above fits better 
He accentuates “na” of “Persona,” which is the pronunciation of 나 (na; I, me) that made the end rhyme of two previous verses.  
He also drops all ɪ from I(/aɪ/) fly(/flaɪ/), die (/daɪ/), and cry (/kraɪ/), so that all lines of the verse end with a- (except go).","“Who am I,” a question that I’ve been asking myself for my whole life

작은 것들을 위한 시 (Boy With Luv),Map of the Soul : 7,2/21/2020,"I’m curious about everything, how’s your day?
 
Oh tell me 
What makes you happy 
Oh text me 
Your every picture 
I’d like to have it by my pillow, oh bae 
Come be my teacher 
Teach me everything about you 
Your 1, your 2 
Listen my my baby, I’m 
flying high up in that sky 
(with the two wings that you gave me then)
 
Now it’s too high up here 
I’d like to have my eyes meet you 
Yeah you makin’ me a boy with luv 
Oh my my my oh my my my 
I’ve waited all my life 
I’d like to be with you at every moment of yours 
Oh my my my oh my my my 
Looking for something right 
Now I feel like I know a bit about it 
I want something stronger 
Than a moment, than a moment, love 
I have waited longer 
For a boy with 
For a boy with luv 
Since I got to know you, ya, my life is filled with you and you only, ya 
A star that is called you, that made every trivial thing non-trivial 
From one to ten, everything is special 
From your interests, the way you walk, the way you talk, and your trivial, small habits 
They say, I, who used to be so small, became a hero (Oh nah) 
I say, things like destiny were never mine from the beginning (Oh nah) 
The world’s peace (No way) 
Some grand rules (No way) 
Just going to protect you, I am
 
(Boy with luv) 
Listen my my baby, I’m 
flying high up in that sky 
(with the two wings that you gave me then) 
Now it’s too high up here 
I’d like to have my eyes meet you 
Yeah you makin’ me a boy with luv 
Oh my my my oh my my my 
You got me high so fast 
I’d like to be with you at every moment of yours 
Oh my my my oh my my my 
You got me fly so fast 
Now I feel like I know a bit about it 
Love is nothing stronger 
Than a boy with luv 
Love is nothing stronger 
Than a boy with luv 
I’ll just talk straight and honest 
There were times when I was acting arrogant without knowing 
The sky that became too high, the hall that became too big 
Sometimes I prayed to let me run away 
But your scar is my scar — 
when I realized it, I promised myself 
that, with Icarus’ wings that you gave me,  
I’d fly to you, not the sun

 
Let me fly 
Oh my my my oh my my my 
I’ve waited all my life 
I’d like to be with you at every moment of yours 
Oh my my my oh my my my 
Looking for something right 
Now I feel like I know a bit about it 
I want something stronger 
Than a moment, than a moment, love 
Love is nothing stronger 
Than a boy with luv","From A Supplementary Story: You Never Walk Alone: “ 
Although I want to fly, I don’t have wings. But your hands become my wings.” 
The above three lines are in line with the idea of an earlier verse: “ 
I’m flying high up in that sky  
(with the two wings that you gave me then). Now it’s too high up here. I’d like to have my eyes meet you,” which also reminds me of Namjoon’s words from (1) the 3rd Muster (November 2016) and (2) the WINGS Tour Final (December 2017), and (3) Jungkook’s interview from the WINGS Tour (June 2017):
 
(1) “To add some more thoughts, seeing ARMY bombs shining and sparkling like this, I feel like I’m in space. I feel like we are in a galaxy in space with many ARMYs. Even if the universe and the galaxy expand and grow in size, I hope you don’t think that the distance between our hearts grows. Your eyes shine brighter than ARMY bombs — every single one of you. To see the starlights in your eyes, and to brighten the lights, we are trying hard.”
(2) “And lastly, one thing that I really wanted to tell you is… you tell us via letters and sometimes messages, “I’m so happy that you’re achieving so much these days, but my life and my dream stay at the same place. You started with me but now are walking away, so I’m very happy but also finding it bittersweet.” But like I said before, even we could not believe in ourselves. We could not believe that we would be able to do it, that we would succeed. When we asked ourselves whether we’d be able to have a concert at the Gymnastics Arena, the answer was “No, I don’t know.” So, what I want to tell you is that we were really shabby in the beginning. But even we made it. So if it’s you, who recognized us, [you will be able to make it]. In your dream, or in your life if it’s not your dream, if our existence, our music, our performance, and our photos and videos can be a little help at some point, and if your pain is 100 and we can make it to 99, 98, 97…, our existence will be valuable enough. I love you, truly.”
(3) “I’ve heard that many fans say they feel like we’re becoming distant. I hope you don’t think like that. As our position gets high, don’t think we are getting distant. As we become high, we will come closer to you step by step, so don’t worry about such a thing.” 
“Instead of flying too close to the sun like Icarus, I’d make myself fly ‘down’ to you and meet your eyes.”","I’m curious about everything, how’s your day?

What","A thyrsus is a wand of giant fennel covered with ivy vines and leaves, sometimes wound with taeniae and topped with a pine cone or by a bunch of vine-leaves and grapes or ivy-leaves and berries. Associated with Dionysus and his followers, it is a symbol of prosperity, fertility, hedonism, and pleasure/enjoyment in general.

옹헤야 (ong-he-ya) is a phrase in Korean folk music, particularly in songs that people sung while harvesting or doing other works. I’m leaving a link to a hip hop rendition of 옹헤야 in case you are interested. 
Kkwaenggwari is a Korean traditional instrument, used primarily in folk music. It serves a particularly important role in samulnori and pungmul, which originate from farmers’ music/performance to ensure and celebrate a good harvest.

Oh boy let me see 
I got a big dream yeah 
Woo, every day, I was excited about how far I’d go 
I was running frantically and somehow reached here 
Yeah, hmm, the shadow at my feet 
Looking down, it’s gotten even bigger 
Even if I run away, following me is 
my shadow that gets darker as that light gets brighter
 
Woo, I’m afraid 
I’m scared of flying high 
No one told me 
how lonely it is here 
That my leap can be my fall
 
Now I know 
that sometimes running away is the second best 
People say, in that bright light, it’s splendor 
But my shadow rather grows even bigger, 
swallows me, and becomes a monster
 
Going higher, higher, and only higher, higher, 
it makes me dizzy 
Going only higher, higher 
I hate it 
I pray, pray that I will be okay 
The moment I’m flying high as I wished, 
my shadow grows larger, beat down upon by that light 
Please don’t let me shine 
Don’t let me down 
Don’t let me fly

it happens to be that I’m high up in the blue, cloudless sky

Don’t let me down 
Don’t let me fly 
Now I’m scared 
Don’t let me shine 
Smile, why are you hesitating for  
Isn’t it something like this that you wished for 
Or cry, what are you afraid of 
Isn’t it something like this that you wanted 
The life you wished for, the life you wanted, 
the life you chose, you achieved everything with no regrets 
On top of that, you have a big house, big cars, big rings,
 
You have everything you wanted
 
 
Then what’s the problem, enjoy 
Or let it go, you don’t want to? 
Then run, or pause 
Stop whining and do one or the other 
You’re saying I haven’t taught you that? (Yeah yeah)
 
You’re asking if I really didn’t  
know? (Oh no) 
I’ll take away exactly as much as you have, whatever it is 
That sometimes your rest can be your fall 
Do you get it only now 
that always doing the best is the first best

I’m you and you’re me, do you get it? 
You’re me and I’m you, do you get it? 
We’re one body and we’ll crash 
We’re you and we’re me, do you get it?","A direct translation is “my shadow that is proportional to that light.” 
SUGA has been using this metaphor frequently, most recently in SUGA’s Interlude. 
The above three lines remind me of the lyrics of The Last where he raps: “ 
The monster, my success earned at the cost of my youth, wants greater wealth. The greed that used to be my weapon now swallows me, ruins me, and puts a leash around my neck.” 
Sidenote: 공교롭게도 often has a negative connotation. Given the context, it should read as something similar to “ironically, I’m up in the blue, cloudless sky.” 
Reference: No More Dream: “I wanna big house, big cars, and big rings.” 
Reference:  
, which references No More Dream: “ 
Big house, big cars, big rings that I dreamed about. Though I have everything I’ve ever wanted, I feel something is missing now — the feeling of unfamiliarity, of someone who achieved everything.” 
Earlier lines:  
아무도 말 안해줬잖아 여기가 얼마나 외로운지 말야 (No one told me how lonely it is here). 
Compare to the earlier lines: “ 
That my leap can be my fall. Now I know that sometimes running away is the second best.” 
SUGA’s lines from Outro: Tear: “This is real you, and this is real me. I’ve now seen the end, and even my resentment doesn’t remain. I woke up from my sweet dream and close my eyes. This is real you, and this is real me.”  
In addition to the pure lyrical similarities, I believe the underlying meanings are also valid across the two. The distinction between “I” and “you” is very vague in almost all LOVE YOURSELF era tracks (it’s very obvious that “I = you” in some tracks). In Intro : Shadow, “you” are “my shadow” (or the other way around; the shadow might be the speaker), which is a part of “I.”
 
The whole acceptance of his shadow as a part of him (or him as a whole) also reminds me of Carl Jung’s words: “Everyone carries a shadow, and the less it is embodied in the individual’s conscious life, the blacker and denser it is.”","

anymore, when listening to music

 
Tryna pull up 
It feels like time has stopped 
Oh that would be my first death 
I been always afraid of 
If this can no longer make me cry 
If this can no longer make my heart flutter 
Perhaps, this will be how I die once 
But what if that moment’s right now 
Right now 
In my ears are only slow heartbeats, bump bump bump 
I try to escape, but into the maw, jump jump jump 
No song can reach me anymore 
I cry out a silent cry 
Sea where all light sinks into silence, yeah yeah yeah
 
It again seizes my ankle that lost the path, yeah yeah yeah
 
No sound can reach me, yeah yeah yeah 
Killin’ me now 
Killin’ me now

I keep losing focus 
Now let go of me, I hate this 
I’d rather go on my own feet 
I’ll jump into it 
At the deepest, 
I saw myself 
Slowly, I open my eyes 
This is my workroom, my studio 
Even if harsh waves brush against me in the darkness, 
I will never get dragged away again 
Inside 
I saw myself myself 
In my ears are only fast heartbeats, bump bump bump 
With my eyes open, into my forest, jump jump jump
 
 
 
Nothing can swallow me


 
I cry out with all my strength

What’s my thang 
What’s my thang tell me now 
Tell me now 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah","Note: By saying 않는대, instead of 않는데, SUGA means to say that he “heard” (1) from someone else that his heart does not beat or (2) about someone else whose heart does not beat. This is different from him coming to a realization, by himself, that his heart no longer beats anymore when listening to music. Based on the following lines, I read it as (1) where he is told that his heart does not beat anymore. 
Alternatively, it could also be interpreted as “If this can no longer resonate with me” 
“A dancer dies twice — once when they stop dancing, and this first death is the more painful.” 
Note: In Sea, a hidden track of LOVE YOURSELF: Her, BTS sings about how the sea it has dreamed of is actually another desert. Sinking to the bottom of the sea with no light, they face their shadow. 
Note: Path is another hidden track of their discography (2 Cool 4 Skool; BTS’ debut single album), where they talk about their path as artists at the onset of their career. In Black Swan, it is the fear of losing the pure passion and love for music that makes them feel lost (in the first half the song) and stand back up again (in the second half of the song).
 
It might be a far stretch to link Sea and Path as the words 바다 (sea) and 길 (path) are not particularly uncommon. But given that they are “hidden” tracks, and that, here in Black Swan, BTS talks about their “hidden” shadow, I think it’s cool to think about the connection. 
A more literal translation would be “Though I try struggling, the surrounding is the bottom/floor.” 
Note: Every moment, even the moment where they struggle at the bottom of the sea, becomes eternity because it is filmed. This reminded me of the scene where people were holding their phones up to take pictures of SUGA in Interlude : Shadow and concept photos (S version) of LOVE YOURSELF: Answer.  
Note: The below verse signals the transition to the second part of the song. In the art film, the main dancer finally escapes the cage surrounded by lasers by the end of this verse that ends with “At the deepest, I saw myself.” 
Note: Notice how the below verse contrasts with a previous verse: “In my ears are only slow heartbeats, bump bump bump / I try to escape, but into the maw, jump jump jump / No song can reach me anymore / I cry out a silent cry.” 
In Butterfly, “ 
My Kafka on the shore, please don’t go to the forest over there” 
In FAKE LOVE, “A forest of just us, you were not there. I forgot the route that I came along.”
Note: In Kafka on the Shore (Haruki Murakami; RM is a known fan of Murakami), the forest is a kind of labyrinth that represents the understanding of the self. Once he feared going into the forest (Butterfly), then he got lost in the forest (FAKE LOVE; this also became the moment for him to realize that it’s all him, that it’s all himself. “You” = “I.”), and now he is jumping into the forest with the conviction that nothing can swallow him. 
In The Last, “The greed that used to be my weapon now swallows me, ruins me, and puts a leash around my neck.” 
In Interlude : Shadow, “People say, in that bright light, it’s splendor / But my shadow rather grows even bigger, swallows me, and  becomes a monster.” 
Note: This is also when, in the art film, the main dancer frees himself from the other dancers, who represent his shadow. 
At the end of the art film, the shadow (the six dancers in black costumes) that had the main dancer confined in the first half transforms itself into a force that sets the dancer free by pushing him to the sky and helping him fly. The dancer becomes a black swan, having made its shadow into its wings.  
Going back to the message of the lyrics, I believe that this represents that it is only after experiencing the fear of losing the love for music, facing the shadow as an artist, and taking control of the shadow that the artist can realize the depth of his love for music and stand up again.","Do your thang

waves rise from time to time

Louder than bombs I sing","This reminds me of the first verse of Two! Three!, “ 
Let’s walk only along the flower path; I can’t say such words. Let’s see only the good things; I can’t say such words as well. That, from now on, there will be only good things, that we will not get hurt anymore, I can’t say such words. I can’t say such lies.” 
Note: A direct translation would be “Since the time I knew that the facial expression you made  was not that facial expression.” My interpretation of these two lines would be something like “since I learned that the smile you showed me does not mean your happiness,” which is also in line with the Storyline above. Fans want to give them only positive energy and love but they see the individual pains we all have inside. 
(As some of you commented under this post, I also hear “brighter” instead of “lighter.”) 
Note: Again, the subtitle of Two! Three! is “Still wishing there will be more good days.”  
Side note: 똥밭에 구르다 (to roll on a field of feces, literally) is usually used as a part of an idiom, 똥밭에 굴러도 이승이 낫다 (Even if you roll on a field of feces, this world is better than the otherworld).","Now it has become too clear,

ON,Map of the Soul : 7,2/21/2020,"I can’t understand what people are sayin’ 
Which tune should I dance to 
The shadow that grows by a step when I walk a step 
Waking up, where is this place that I open my eyes to 
Maybe Seoul, or New York, or Paris 
Standing up, my body is reeling 
Look at my feet, look down 
The shadow that resembles me 
Is it this guy that is shaking 
or is it the tips of my small feet 
There’s no way that I’m not afraid 
There’s no way that everything is okay 
But, I know 
Awkwardly, I flow 
With that black wind, I fly

Hey na na na

Bring it, bring the pain oh yeah 
Bring the pain 
It will all become my blood and flesh 
Bring the pain 
No fear, since I know the way 
To the small things, breathe
 
In the darkness, they are my oxygen and light, 
the power of those that make me be me 
Even if I fall, I get back up, scream

Note: ~하소서 (please do ~) is a very formally polite style that was traditionally used when addressing a king or a queen and is now used only in historical dramas and religious text. When it comes to 숨 쉬다 (to breathe), the official translations in music video subtitles have these two lines as “Where my pain lies, let me take a breath.” But, 숨 쉬게 하소서 (please let me breathe) is not about pausing or a one-time activity of breathing in and out. It is closer to a statement — a declaration that he is determined to exist where his pain lies, accepting the pain instead of being afraid of and running away from it.","I can’t understand what people are sayin’

둥둥둥 [doongdoongdoong] is an onomatopoeic word for drum sounds 
둥둥둥 [doongdoongdoong] is an onomatopoeic word for drum sounds 
툭툭 [tooktook] is an onomatopoeic word for tapping someone. 
담그다 typically means (1) to immerse something in the water or (2) make food (kimchi or other fermented foods, specifically), with 푹푹 [pookpook] being the sound of pushing down something. (It sometimes, within context, is used to people as a dramatic threat to kill them (by drowning). 푹푹 can be the sound of stabbing as well.) 
Wordplay: 분노 (憤怒; pronounced boonno; rage) vs. 분뇨 (糞尿; pronounced boonnyo; feces and urine) 
Note: 질리다 has a couple of other meanings including (1) to be sick of something and (2) to be terrified by something. I chose to interpret it as “be numb” based on the following verse. 
 [ge wae] 
 [dae wae] 
[eh hem] 
Ahem here carries a certain attitude and is more of a sign of “I’m here to give you a lesson.” This entire verse is a typical remark of malicious commenters on the internet, claiming that celebrities need to know how to accept malicious anger towards them because they are famous and rich. 
They pronounce ahem as A-hem [aihem] and playfully bring in B-hem.","Spark, those embers flaring up again

V revealed on Weverse that it was an argument between “let’s do the choreography practice and eat” and “let’s eat as we practice.” 
It’s more like, “Hey Jimin, do you want to have a drink tonight?” (V makes a bottle-opening sound after 오늘 [oh-neul; today].) 
While filming the 2017 summer package, V had a nightmare and Jimin bought him a dreamcatcher necklace the next day with a small amount of prize money he earned from playing a game with the members.","Seoul that was particularly sparkling

Respect,Map of the Soul : 7,2/21/2020,"Put your hands in the air 
(Put your hands in the air) 
Just like you don’t care 
(Just like you don’t care) 
Ayo SUGA the word that floats around me these days, 
“Respect” — but I’m a bit confused by its meaning these days 
They say they “that” someone, whenever that someone does something 
I don’t know that well either, brotha, how would I know 
It surely belongs to a higher tier than love 
A higher tier, perhaps the highest tier 
A concept that belongs to that, 
isn’t that respect, huh? 
Re-spect, like the word itself, it’s to look and look again 
When you keep looking at someone, you’re bound to see their flaws 
But, the fact that you nonetheless want to keep looking 
requires absolute faith in that someone, 
which is why I can’t really say it so easily 
They’re immeasurable, its weight and thickness 
That someday I’ll be able to say it confidently, 
with all my heart, to myself, and to you 
Please don’t say “respect” so easily, yeah 
because even I still don’t really know it well, yeah 
because even I’m afraid of myself sometimes, 
wondering if they see through the weak me 
(Respect) They say it so easily 
(Respect) when they don’t know what it is 
(Respect) I hope they re-spect 
(Respect) One time 
(Respect) Two times 
(Respect) I won’t say it so easily 
(Respect) Though I still don’t know it well 
(Respect) Someday, I will say it 
(Respect) One time 
(Respect) Two times 
What is respect 
I’m asking because I don’t know, dude 
What even is respect 
that everyone talks about respect 
Honestly, I can’t understand 
that to admire someone 
was such an easy thing 
I still can’t understand 
To be completely honest, there’s no need for admiration
 
when there’s not even any acknowledgment 
That, behind your back, they talk bad about you 
everyone except you knows, well 
I honestly respect you 
I have zero expectation that you’d also respect me, so skip it 
Respect, I respect you 
Appluase to that friend who is speaking ill while smiling

(Respect) Oh yeah I’ll","The word respect can be etymologically broken into “re” (back, again) and “spectāre” (to observe, to look at). 
(= I hope they look into it again; wordplay across Korean and English.) 
Side note: 솔까 is a slang, an acronym of 솔직히 까놓고 말해서, which means “to strip it down and talk openly.” 
Note: 뒤에서 호박씨 까다 (to shell pumpkin seeds in the back) is an idiom used when someone pretends to be nice to someone else and talks behind them (or say one thing in front of someone else and secretly do another thing). 
Note: Bangtan’s motto, on the contrary, is “Dream, hope, forward, forward.”

Outro : Ego,Map of the Soul : 7,2/21/2020,"I go back every day 
to myself of back then 
To the life where I chose to give up, 
I place myself 
But, in the world, there are  
some unchanging truths — 
that time flows forward, 
that there are no ifs 
When they feel distant, the memories of those days come flooding back 
Touch of the devil, and fateful recall 
I still wonder why it called me again 
Every day, ask me, guess it, whip it, repeat, oh 
Telling myself that nothing will change, I, eventually, again, 
lock my worries up, close 
How much love, how much joy 
I comfort myself and stay calm, alone 
Yeah, I don’t care, everything is my 
fate’s choice, so we’re here 
I look ahead, the way is shinin’ 
Keep goin’ now

That way, way, way 
Wherever my way 
Only ego, ego, ego 
Just trust myself 
The life of Jung Hoseok who is not J-Hope flashes across my mind 
It must have been full of regret with no hope till I die, 
with my dance only chasing ghosts,
 
with me blaming my dream 
and casting doubt on why I live and breathe 
Oh my God God God God 
Time goes by 
The worries of 7 years finally come out of my mouth 
All the oppressions get resolved 
Into my heart are the answers from those I trusted the most 
One and only hope, one and only soul 
One and only smile, one and only you 
The answer that became clear, to the truth of the world, 
is a me that is unchanging 
Right  
Now I don’t care, everything is my 
fate’s choice, so we’re here 
I look ahead, the way is shinin’ 
Keep goin’ now

That way, way, way 
Wherever my way 
Only ego, ego, ego 
Just trust myself 
Whatever I believed, 
wherever I went, 
(That way, way, way) 
became my fate 
and became my core 
(Wherever my way) 
Whether or not I was exhausted 
or whether or not I was sad,
 
(Only ego, ego, ego) 
it became my comfort, 
and help me know myself

and casting doubt on why I live and breathe 
Oh my God God God God 
 
The worries of 7 years finally come out of my mouth 
All the oppressions get resolved 
Into my heart are the answers from those I trusted the most 
One and only , one and only 
One and only , one and only you 
The answer that became clear, to the truth of the world, 
is a me that is unchanging 
Right  
Now , everything is my 
fate’s choice,  
I look ahead,  
Keep goin’ now 
(Ready, set, and begin) 
That way, way, way 
Wherever my way 
Only  
Just trust myself 
Whatever I believed, 
wherever I went, 
(That way, way, way) 
became my fate 
and became my core 
() 
Whether or not I was exhausted 
or whether or not I was sad,
 
(Only ) 
it became my comfort, 
and help me know myself

Note: ~하소서 (please do ~) is a very formally polite style that was traditionally used when addressing a king or a queen and is now used only in historical dramas and religious text. When it comes to 숨 쉬다 (to breathe), the official translations in music video subtitles have these two lines as “Where my pain lies, let me take a breath.” But, 숨 쉬게 하소서 (please let me breathe) is not about pausing or a one-time activity of breathing in and out. It is closer to a statement — a declaration that he is determined to exist where his pain lies, accepting the pain instead of being afraid of and running away from it.","I can’t understand what people are sayin’

Intro: Persona,Map of the Soul: Persona,12/4/2019,"“Who am I,” a question that I’ve been asking myself for my whole life 
A question that I will probably never be able to find the right answer for 
If I were answerable with only a few words,  
God wouldn’t have created all those various beauties
 
How you feel? How are you feeling right now? 
Actually, I’m really good, but it’s a little uncomfortable  
I’m still not sure if I’m a dog, a pig, or whatever,
 Am I Wrong translation
 
but then others come and put a pearl necklace on me, ptui!
 
At least I laugh more than before 
A superhero that I wished to be, 
now it feels like I really became one 
But why is there more and more blabbering  
One says “run,” and another says “stop” 
This one says “look at the forest,” and that one says “look at the wildflower” 
My shadow, I named him “hesitation” and called him so 
Once he became it, he has never hesitated 
Whether it is under the stage or under the light, he keeps appearing  
and stares at me fiercely like heat haze (Oh shit) 
Hey, have you already forgotten why you started this? 
You were just loving it that there’s someone listening to you 
Sometimes, everything feels like total nonsense 
You know what comes out of you when you’re drunk, it’s like acting silly 
Someone like me isn’t good enough for (doing) music 
Someone like me isn’t good enough for (delivering) the truth 
Someone like me isn’t good enough for (answering) the calling 
Someone like me isn’t good enough to be a muse 
My flaws that I know, maybe those are really all I’ve got 
The world is actually not interested at all in my clumsiness 
When I tossed and tumbled every night with the regrets that I don’t even get sick of anymore 
and twisted the irreversible time like a habit, 
it was the first question that raised me to stand up every time 
‘But,’ the word that should come before the three syllables of my name
 
So I’m askin’ once again yeah 
Who the hell am I? 
Tell me all your names baby 
Do you wanna die? 
Oh do you wanna go? 
Do you wanna fly? 
Where’s your soul? Where’s your dream? 
Do you think you’re alive? 
(How about you?) 
(I don’t know, man) 
(But I know one thing) 
Yeah my name is R
 
The ‘me’ who I remember and who people know 
The ‘me’ who I created by myself to speak my mind 
Yeah, I might have been deceiving myself, I might have been lying 
But, I’m not ashamed of it, t 
his is the map of my soul 
Dear myself 
You must never lose your temperature 
because you don’t need to be warm or cold 
Though I might sometimes pretend I’m good and sometimes pretend I’m evil,
 
this is the barometer of my direction that I want to set
 
The ‘me’ who I want to be
 
The ‘me’ who people want 
The ‘me’ who I love  
And the ‘me’ who I craft 
The ‘me’ who’s smiling 
The ‘me’ who’s crying sometimes 
Living and breathing every second, every moment, even now, 
Persona
 
Who the hell am I? 
I just wanna go 
I just wanna fly 
I just wanna give you all the voices till I die 
I just wanna give you all the shoulders when you cry

Cry","Beauties = different “I”s, different personas 
As explained in 
, “a dog or a pig” is used in a sarcastic manner since it is a term used to belittle the general public. 
Reference: “casting pearls before swine.”
RM doesn’t know what he is and then others come and put a pearl necklace on him (who could be “a pig”) and treat him as someone pearl-worthy, making him uncomfortable. 
Wordplay: 보라 하다 is “to say to see,” where 보라 comes from 보다 (to see). However, with 보라 as a noun meaning purple, 보라하다 (to purple) is used by BTS and their fans as “to love.” The above line, therefore, can be “this one loves forests, and that one loves wildflowers.” 
Note: Although “shadow” here is the shadow in Jungian psychology, the above four lines reminded me of his interview at the beginning of 2018. He calls his anxiety his shadow. It grew as his height grew, and it grows at night. He also acknowledges and accepts that the shadow will follow him wherever he goes and whatever he does, and therefore tries to become friends with his shadow rather than separating himself from it.  (Translation of the full interview is available here.) 

 
(From here, it’s his shadow talking.) 
Wordplay: 취기 (chwigi; 醉氣)  is intoxication or tipsiness and 치기 (chigi; 稚氣) means childishness, immaturity, or foolishness. When you get drunk, you get tipsy and act like a child. 
소명 (somyoung; calling, mission) here can be a religious calling or a great mission. 
I’ve seen many people speculating that he is aware of and is using the “but Namjoon- ” thing. I personally strongly doubt if that’s the case since (1) it is almost strictly used in non-Korean (language-wise) fandoms, especially on “stan Twitter,” and (2) it doesn’t really work within the context anyway.
My interpretation of this line (again, this is my personal interpretation) is that this really is about his fundamental question, the question he’s been asking himself for his entire life and is still trying to figure out the answer (if there is one) for, the question that pops up every time he agonizes and regrets, and the question that really penetrates through the entire song. “But, who am I?” “But, (who is) Kim Namjoon?” 
(1) The letter R embraces all his rapper-selves: Runch Randa (his stage name as an underground rapper), Rap Monster (his stage name from 2013 to late 2017), and RM (late 2017 to now). It also connects to the lyrics of Answer: Love Yourself: “Y 
esterday’s me, today’s me, tomorrow’s me. Without exception, altogether, they are all me.”
(2) From “Voice” (the first track of his first mixtape): “Yeah, I be real. This moment, the thing that I wanted desperately. I’m finally oiling the pedals that I’ve been stepping on for seven years. You can’t kill. Come take it if you do want a piece of me. I only speak through music, I have no interest in anything else. If you really think you ready to fly with my power. This is what R is about, fella the time is now.” 
Notice how he acknowledges the possibility between warm and cold and between good and evil, which is a repeating concept from Love Yourself era. 

 
Note (not sure he meant this but): 척도 (cheokdo; barometer, criterion) can be separated into 척 and 도. 척 alone, placed after adjectives, makes “pretend to be ~,” and 도 is a postposition that used when listing similar things. Both go well with the previous line in terms of meaning and rhyme.  
It can also be “I who want to be me,” although the one above fits better 
He accentuates “na” of “Persona,” which is the pronunciation of 나 (na; I, me) that made the end rhyme of two previous verses.  
He also drops all ɪ from I(/aɪ/) fly(/flaɪ/), die (/daɪ/), and cry (/kraɪ/), so that all lines of the verse end with a- (except go).","“Who am I,” a question that I’ve been asking myself for my whole life

작은 것들을 위한 시 (Boy With Luv),Map of the Soul: Persona,12/4/2019,"I’m curious about everything, how’s your day?

What makes you happy

Teach me everything about you 
Your 1, your 2 
Listen my my baby, I’m 
flying high up in that sky

For a boy with luv 
Since I got to know you, ya, my life is filled with you and you only, ya 
A star that is called you, that made every trivial thing non-trivial 
From one to ten, everything is special 
From your interests, the way you walk, the way you talk, and your trivial, small habits 
They say, I, who used to be so small, became a hero (Oh nah) 
I say, things like destiny were never mine from the beginning (Oh nah) 
The world’s peace (No way) 
Some grand rules (No way) 
Just going to protect you, I am

Love is nothing stronger 
Than a boy with luv 
Love is nothing stronger 
Than a boy with luv 
I’ll just talk straight and honest 
There were times when I was acting arrogant without knowing 
The sky that became too high, the hall that became too big 
Sometimes I prayed to let me run away 
But your scar is my scar — 
when I realized it, I promised myself 
that, with Icarus’ wings that you gave me,  
I’d fly to you, not the sun

 
Let me fly

Than a boy with luv","From A Supplementary Story: You Never Walk Alone: “ 
Although I want to fly, I don’t have wings. But your hands become my wings.” 
The above three lines are in line with the idea of an earlier verse: “ 
I’m flying high up in that sky  
(with the two wings that you gave me then). Now it’s too high up here. I’d like to have my eyes meet you,” which also reminds me of Namjoon’s words from (1) the 3rd Muster (November 2016) and (2) the WINGS Tour Final (December 2017), and (3) Jungkook’s interview from the WINGS Tour (June 2017):
 
(1) “To add some more thoughts, seeing ARMY bombs shining and sparkling like this, I feel like I’m in space. I feel like we are in a galaxy in space with many ARMYs. Even if the universe and the galaxy expand and grow in size, I hope you don’t think that the distance between our hearts grows. Your eyes shine brighter than ARMY bombs — every single one of you. To see the starlights in your eyes, and to brighten the lights, we are trying hard.”
(2) “And lastly, one thing that I really wanted to tell you is… you tell us via letters and sometimes messages, “I’m so happy that you’re achieving so much these days, but my life and my dream stay at the same place. You started with me but now are walking away, so I’m very happy but also finding it bittersweet.” But like I said before, even we could not believe in ourselves. We could not believe that we would be able to do it, that we would succeed. When we asked ourselves whether we’d be able to have a concert at the Gymnastics Arena, the answer was “No, I don’t know.” So, what I want to tell you is that we were really shabby in the beginning. But even we made it. So if it’s you, who recognized us, [you will be able to make it]. In your dream, or in your life if it’s not your dream, if our existence, our music, our performance, and our photos and videos can be a little help at some point, and if your pain is 100 and we can make it to 99, 98, 97…, our existence will be valuable enough. I love you, truly.”
(3) “I’ve heard that many fans say they feel like we’re becoming distant. I hope you don’t think like that. As our position gets high, don’t think we are getting distant. As we become high, we will come closer to you step by step, so don’t worry about such a thing.” 
“Instead of flying too close to the sun like Icarus, I’d make myself fly ‘down’ to you and meet your eyes.”","I’m curious about everything, how’s your day?
 
Oh tell me 
What makes you happy

I want something stronger 
Than a moment, than a moment, love 
I have waited longer 
For a boy with 
For a boy with luv 
Since I got to know you, , my life is filled with you and you only, 
A star that is called you, that made every trivial thing non-trivial 
From one to ten, everything is special 
From your interests, the way you walk, the way you talk, and your trivial, small habits 
They say, I, who used to be so small, became a hero () 
I say, things like destiny were never mine from the beginning () 
The world’s peace () 
Some grand rules () 
Just going to protect you, I am

Now I feel like I know a bit about it 
Love is nothing stronger 
Than a boy with luv 
Love is nothing stronger 
Than a boy with luv 
I’ll just talk straight and honest 
There were times when I was acting arrogant without knowing 
The that became too high, the  that became too big 
Sometimes I prayed to let me run away 
 your scar is my scar — 
when I realized it, I promised myself 
that, with Icarus’ wings that you gave me,  
I’d fly to you, not the sun

HOME,Map of the Soul: Persona,12/4/2019,"Because of my heart fluttering like it’s gone mad, 
I couldn’t even leave a good-bye 
Yeah I’m going out baby 
The entire world is my home 
Crazy for myself 
As if everything will come true once I open that door, 
as if I was going to show the world something big, 
I left home 
(Hoping that all these imaginations don’t stay as a mirage) 
Oh yeah I did it, me shine with flashin’ lights 
Got lotta friends, a tranquil, peaceful space of mine 
Yeah, I remember the time when I used to feel I could do everything 
I saw the ocean, yeah, even before opening this door 
Oh yeah 
The more I fill it, the emptier it gets somehow 
The more I am with someone else, the more I feel alone

 
Half-closed eyes, a sleepless night 
The place where you are  
Perhaps that place is my home 
With you I’mma feel rich 
That very place is my home 
Turn it on before , your switch 
Yeah

Even when I close my eyes under the blanket, I feel strange 
My feet feel like they are floating in the air, my eyes feel like they are spinning 
In this gorgeous place, I feel so shabby 
It feels so shabby 
The world thinks that we have it all 
Big house, big cars, big rings that I dreamed about
 
Though I have everything I’ve ever wanted, 
I feel something is missing now — the feeling of unfamiliarity, of someone who achieved everything 
But, the door I exit because I have a place to return even if I leave now 
At the fork of the road, I keep thinking of you 
who recognized me who had nothing 
I was able to smile thinking of you

You know you got that

One day, 
when the bell rings three times, 
will you open the door 
so that I can deliver my words that I couldn’t say 
I’ll say them then

With you I just feel rich 
I’m back, hi my home
 
You had your switch turned on 
Yeah

You know you got that 
Home 
Your love your love your love (I miss that) 
Your love your love your love (I want that) 
Your touch your touch your touch (I need that) 
La la la la la la la la I love it","Note: 인사 includes hello, good-bye, and everything else of a similar kind. The 인사 here seems like a good-bye (or its kind) since he went out feeling like the entire world is his, with his heart fluttering.
Something that I want to mention (as an additional note) before proceeding is the 인사 “다녀오겠습니다” and “다녀왔습니다.” (BTS tweets “다녀오겠습니다” and its variations all the time when they are going to a foreign country.) 다녀오겠습니다 literally means “I’ll go and come back” while 다녀왔습니다 is “I’ve come after going away.” Both are pretty awkward when translated into English, but they are common expressions used when someone is leaving a place where they “belong” emotionally or physically. You’d say 다녀오겠습니다 when you’re leaving home (to school/work, for a trip, etc.) or briefly leaving where you’re supposed to be (eg. going to the bathroom during class). It’s a promise that you’ll safely come back to where you belong. Throughout the song, BTS describes ARMY as “my home,” making the whole 다녀오겠습니다/다녀왔습니다 thing relevant.
 
It could be (1) the more time I spend with others (specifically, someone else) or (2) the more people I spend time with.  
(I come back) 
From No More Dream: “I wanna big house, big cars, and big rings.” 
 [jigeum] 
 [irun] 
 [gibun]
I feel something is missing now — the feeling of unfamiliarity, of someone who achieved everything 
(I come back) 
다녀왔어 is an informal form of 다녀왔습니다 (I’ve come after going away). “My home” (=ARMY) is where BTS belong. 
This is a departure from earlier verses where it was “말을 안 해도 편안할 거야 (even if nothing is said, it will be comfortable.”)","Because of my heart fluttering like it’s gone mad,

What","A thyrsus is a wand of giant fennel covered with ivy vines and leaves, sometimes wound with taeniae and topped with a pine cone or by a bunch of vine-leaves and grapes or ivy-leaves and berries. Associated with Dionysus and his followers, it is a symbol of prosperity, fertility, hedonism, and pleasure/enjoyment in general.

옹헤야 (ong-he-ya) is a phrase in Korean folk music, particularly in songs that people sung while harvesting or doing other works. I’m leaving a link to a hip hop rendition of 옹헤야 in case you are interested. 
Kkwaenggwari is a Korean traditional instrument, used primarily in folk music. It serves a particularly important role in samulnori and pungmul, which originate from farmers’ music/performance to ensure and celebrate a good harvest.

Perhaps it is the providence of the universe 
It just had to be like this

Trivia 承: Love,Love Yourself 結 ‘Answer’,8/24/2018,"Is this love 
Is this love 
Sometimes I know 
Sometimes I don’t 
The next lyrics umm 
What should I write umm 
There are so many words circulating around me, 
but none feels like how I feel 
I can just feel it 
like the moon surely rises after the sun rises, 
like fingernails grow, 
like the trees undress themselves layer by layer when the winter comes, 
that you are the one who will give meaning to my memories 
that you are the one who will make a person into a love

 
Before knowing you, my heart was filled with straight lines only 
I’m just a human, human, human 
You erode all my edges 
and make me a love, love, love 
We are humans, humans, humans 
Among those countlessly many straight lines, 
my love, love, love 
When we gently sit on it, it becomes a heart 
I live so I love

I live so I love 
(Live & love, live & love) 
(If it’s love, I will love you) 
You make I to an O
 
I learned thanks to you 
why person and love  sound similar 
You make live to a love 
Live to a love 
I learned thanks to you 
why a person should live by loving 
Though the distance between I and U is long 
F*** JKLMNOPQRST 
I crossed all the letters and reached you

One and only love (One and only love)","기억 [記憶; pronounced gieok] and 추억 [追憶; pronounced chueok] are both commonly translated as memory, but the former means past experiences or knowledge stored in our brain (recollection) while the latter means (usually fond and positive) experiences that are reminiscent of someone or some old days. 
사람 [saram] to 사랑 [sarang]. 
Notice how ㅁ, the consonant in the bottom of 람 of 사람, is comprised of four straight lines. 
For 사람 to become 사랑, the edges of ㅁ have to be smoothed out so that ㅁ can become ㅇ. Similar to English, but not in the entirely same way, the word “edge” is used to describe people in Korean. A person with edges is someone who is difficult and unsociable. “You” are the one who melts “my” edges away to make me into someone who is able to love (or who is a love). 
Imagine gently pressing the top of ㅇ (that used to be ㅁ) towards the center to make a heart-shape. 
(1) Live to Love, (2) a straight line to a full circle, which represents the notions of totality, wholeness, and the self 
 [saram] 
[sarang] 
[nae] 
[ne] 
Or, “Wind, wind, wind that brushes by.” 바람 can be (1) wind or (2) a noun form of 바라다, which means to wish or to hope.  
There is no verb in the original lyrics, so the decision to put “love” was made purely based on my own interpretation. 
Or, “You’re my wind, wind, wind”","

Intro: Singularity,Love Yourself 結 ‘Answer’,8/24/2018,"A sound of something breaking 
I suddenly wake up from sleep 
A sound full of unfamiliarity 
I cover my ears 
but I can’t fall asleep 
My throat gets sorer 
I try to wrap it 
but I don’t have a voice 
I hear that sound today, yet again 
It’s ringing again, that sound 
A crack on this frozen lake, yet again 
You know I threw myself in that lake 
You know I buried my voice for you 
On the winter lake I threw myself in 
a thick ice has formed 
Even in the dream I briefly went into 
the phantom pain that tortures me remains still 
Have I lost myself 
or have I gained you 
I suddenly run to the lake 
Oh, in the lake there is my face 
I beg you, please, don’t say any word

I hear that sound today, yet again 
It’s ringing again, that sound 
A crack on this frozen lake, yet again 
You know I threw myself in that lake 
You know I buried my voice for you 
On the winter lake I threw myself in 
a thick ice has formed 
Even in the dream I briefly went into 
the phantom pain that tortures me remains still 
Have I lost myself 
or have I gained you 
I suddenly run to the lake 
Oh, in the lake there is my face 
I beg you, please, don’t say any word 
I reach my hand to cover the mouth,

전하지 못한 진심 (The Truth Untold) Ft. Steve Aoki,Love Yourself 結 ‘Answer’,8/24/2018,"This garden where loneliness is in full bloom

Trivia 轉: Seesaw,Love Yourself 結 ‘Answer’,8/24/2018,"In the beginning, well, it was fun 
Just going up and down itself 
Before we knew, we both became sick of 
meaningless waste of emotions 
A repeated seesaw, seesaw game 
Having come this far, I got sick of, got sick of it 
A repeated seesaw, seesaw game 
We’re both got tired and became sick of it 
Was the small argument the beginning? 
The moment when I became heavier than you 
There has never been a paralleled balance from the beginning– 
would that be why we were more eager to reach the balance? 
If it was love, and if it is the word love itself, 
would there be any need to repeat it? 
It seems like we’re both tired and holding the same card in our hands 
Then, well… 
All right, a repeated seesaw game 
I try to put an end to it only now 
All right, a boring seesaw game

Let’s not drag it on and do as we please 
Let’s now make the decision whether to get off or not

Now, stop 
How crafty the heart of a person is 
Though we know one will get hurt if the other is not there, 
because we both don’t want to be the bad guy, 
we continue to awkwardly pass the buck, umm umm 
and end up becoming exhausted, ironically reaching the paralleled balance 
Ay, this is not the kind of balance that I wanted 
In the beginning, we brag about who is heavier 
and smile, looking at each other 
Now we became to compete over who is heavier 
It became a tinderbox for a war 
It seems like, eventually, someone will have to get off to end it 
We should stop pretending to care for each other and decide now  
If we didn’t have feelings for each other, 
if we didn’t think of each other, 
would we have dragged it on like this?

Outro: Tear,Love Yourself 結 ‘Answer’,8/24/2018,"Goodbye, to me, is tear 
Even without my noticing, it comes into bloom around my eyes 
Words that I couldn’t let out now flow 
The lingering love crawls on my face 
For a time, you were my dear 
But now, the beer tastes only bitter 
My heart stained with a belated self-hatred 
gets emptied even by that wind brushing by 
Goodbye that ended up coming to me is what I deserve at the end of my playacting full of lies 
If someone turned back time for me, 
could I maybe have been more honest 
My bare face that only I know, 
and my ugly and humble old friends within myself 
Could you have still loved me with the smile you used to make looking at me 
Forever, stop saying things like forever 
There’s gotta be an end anyway 
if there’s a beginning I don’t wanna listen to that 
Advice that’s too right or too many words of comfort I don’t wanna listen to that

At the moment a word comes out of your mouth, 
at the moment where our focus becomes irregular, 
At the moment where everything is in danger, 
our end that those two letters presented to us
 
I should have not shed tears I should have not torn it off 
I can’t say things like that

Epiphany,Love Yourself 結 ‘Answer’,8/24/2018,"It’s so odd, I loved you so much for sure 
I adapted myself entirely to you, I wanted to live for you 
But as I kept doing so, I became unable to bear the storm inside my heart

I’m Fine,Love Yourself 結 ‘Answer’,8/24/2018,"I open my eyes under the painfully blue sky

Answer: Love Myself,Love Yourself 結 ‘Answer’,8/24/2018,"I open my eyes in the darkness 
When the sound of my beating heart feels unfamiliar, 
I face you in the mirror 
An afraid look, a long-pending question 
Perhaps, than loving someone else, 
it is more difficult to love myself 
Let’s be honest and admit what we have to admit 
that your standards are more strict when they are applied to you 
The wide growth ring in your life 
That is also a part of you, that is also you 
So let’s forgive yourself now

Yeah, knowing the presence of such beauty

The longer a growing season is, the wider the corresponding ring is. “The wide growth ring in your life” therefore seems to mean a hardship or a dark period you have managed to go through in your life.

Magic Shop,Love Yourself 結 ‘Answer’,8/24/2018,"I know that you’re hesitating because, even if you speak your true heart, 
it all comes back as scars 
I won’t say obvious things like ‘cheer up,’ 
but I’ll rather share with you my story 
What did I say, 
I told you that we’d win
 
I couldn’t believe (really) 
that we’d be able to win
 
This miracle that isn’t a miracle,
 
did we make it? 
(No) I was here, 
and you’re the one came to me 
I do believe your galaxy
 
I want to listen to your melody, 
how the stars of your galaxy
 
will embroider your sky 
At the end of my despair, 
I found you at last, don’t forget 
You’re the last reason for me who was standing on the edge of cliff 
Live 
On a day you hate being yourself, on a day you want to disappear forever,
 
let’s build a door in your mind 
Once you open the door and enter, this place will wait for you 
It’s okay to believe Magic Shop that will comfort you 
Drinking a cup of hot tea, 
looking up to the galaxy, 
you’ll be alright oh here it is Magic Shop 
So show me (I’ll show you) 
So show me (I’ll show you) 
So show me (I’ll show you) 
Show you show you 
Like roses when blooming 
Like cherry blossoms when fluttering 
Like morning glories when fading
 
Like that beautiful moment 
I always wanted to become the best 
So I was impatient and anxious 
To compare myself against others became my daily life, 
and my greed, which used to be my weapon, became a leash that chokes me
 
But then, looking back, actually, I 
feel like it’s not that I wanted to become the best 
I wanted to comfort and move your heart 
I want to take away your sorrow and pain 
On a day you hate being yourself, on a day you want to disappear forever, 
let’s build a door in your mind 
Once you open the door and enter, this place will wait for you 
It’s okay to believe Magic Shop that will comfort you 
Drinking a cup of hot tea, 
looking up to the galaxy, 
you’ll be alright oh here it is Magic Shop 
So show me (I’ll show you) 
So show me (I’ll show you) 
So show me (I’ll show you) 
Show you show you 
Would you believe if I told you that I, too, was afraid of everything- 
all the true hearts and all the remaining time 
All your answers are in this place where you found, 
in your galaxy, in your mind
 
You gave me the best of me
 
So you’ll give you the best of you
 
You found me You recognized me
 
You gave me the best of me 
So you’ll give you the best of you 
You’ll find the galaxy inside you 
So show me (I’ll show you) 
So show me (I’ll show you) 
So show me (I’ll show you) 
Show you show you","Reference: RM’s tweet (English translation) 
Reference: RM’s talk during Wings Tour the Final: “Even we could not believe that we’d be able to do this, that we’d succeed.” 
Another way to interpret this line is to read 이 기적 as 이기적, which means selfish. Then the translation becomes ‘the miracle that isn’t selfish’ or ‘the miracle that is made possible because we weren’t selfish’ 
Reference: RM’s tweet 
RM used 은하수 (galaxy) quite a lot in the past (in concerts, in his fancafe posts, on Twitter (English translation), etc.)  In the 3rd Muster, he called the sea of ARMY BOMBs a galaxy and said “Even if this universe and this galaxy expand and grow larger, please don’t think that the distance between our hearts grows farther. Your eyes shine brighter than ARMY BOMBs. We are truly one in this galaxy.” He also used ‘galaxy’ in his mixtape track, ‘I Believe.’ 
Direct translation will be ‘on a day I hate being myself, on a day I want to disappear forever.’ But my interpretation is that BTS is speaking this line in the perspective of ARMY. This makes sense given the context that this song is an invitation for ARMY to Magic Shop where they can comfort their soul and love themselves.

Reference: lyrics from The Last by Agust D: ‘무기였던 욕심이 되려 날 집어 삼키고 망치며 때론 목줄을 거네 (the greed that used to be my weapon now swallows me, ruins me, and puts a leash around my neck)’ 
During a V Live, RM said (around 35:20) “I’m kind of slow in writing music these days. I’m working on it, though. It was going pretty smoothly for a while, but then currently I’m going through a stagnant phase. So I’m listening to various things to learn what’s good and also reading your letters. Well, but the answer will be inside me after all, right? Your answer is also inside you. You can find it.”

Reference: RM’s talk during Wings Tour the Final: “Even we made it. You, who recognized us, will surely be able to make it.” ","I know that you’re hesitating because, even if you speak your true heart, 
it all comes back as scars 
I won’t say obvious things like ‘cheer up,’ 
but I’ll rather share with you my story 
What did I say, 
I told you that we’d win
 
I couldn’t believe (really) 
that we’d be able to win
 
This miracle that isn’t a miracle,
 
did we make it? 
 I was here, 
and you’re the one came to me 
I do believe your galaxy
 
I want to listen to your melody, 
how the stars of your galaxy
 
will embroider your sky 
At the end of my despair, 
I found you at last, don’t forget 
You’re the last reason for me who was standing on the edge of cliff 
Live 
On a day you hate being yourself, on a day you want to disappear forever,
 
let’s build a door in your mind 
Once you open the door and enter, this place will wait for you 
It’s okay to believe  that will comfort you 
Drinking a cup of hot tea, 
looking up to the galaxy, 
you’ll be alright  here it is  
So show me (I’ll show you) 
So show me (I’ll show you) 
So show me (I’ll show you) 
Show you show you 
Like roses when blooming 
Like cherry blossoms when fluttering 
Like morning glories when fading
 
Like that beautiful moment 
I always wanted to become the best 
So I was impatient and anxious 
To compare myself against others became my daily life, 
and my greed, which used to be my weapon, became a leash that chokes me
 
But then, looking back, actually, I 
feel like it’s not that I wanted to become the best 
I wanted to comfort and move your heart 
I want to take away your sorrow and pain 
On a day you hate being yourself, on a day you want to disappear forever, 
let’s build a door in your mind 
Once you open the door and enter, this place will wait for you 
It’s okay to believe  that will comfort you 
Drinking a cup of hot tea, 
looking up to the galaxy, 
you’ll be alright oh here it is  
So show me (I’ll show you) 
So show me (I’ll show you) 
So show me (I’ll show you) 
Show you show you 
Would you believe if I told you that I, too, was afraid of everything- 
all the true hearts and all the remaining time 
All your answers are in this place where you found, 
in your galaxy, in your mind
 
You gave me the best of me
 
So you’ll give you the best of you
 
You found me You recognized me
 
You gave me the best of me 
So you’ll give you the best of you 
You’ll find the galaxy inside you 
So show me (I’ll show you) 
So show me (I’ll show you) 
So show me (I’ll show you) 
Show you show you","Note

(2) 달리다 (run) can mean “to drink and get wasted.” e.g. “Shall we run tonight?” “I ran too hard last night.” 
(3) “I earn and I squander” gives a feel like “the money I blow away is earned by no one but me, so you can’t judge me. I do what I want.” 
[nimo] 
Nemo here likely refers to Captain Nemo from Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea. J-Hope also raps “I’m Captain Nemo” in this mixtape track, “Hope World”. The choreography here resembles jump-rope moves, but also reminds me of  
fish flapping its fins, which then reminds me of Nemo from Finding Nemo.  
 [meolliro] 
[piro] 
 [jiro] 
Jiro Ono is a famous Japanese chef who owns a three-Michelin-starred sushi restaurant (Sukiyabashi Jiro). The tasting omakase costs 30,000 JPY. 
열일하다 is a slang (shortened form) of 열심히 일하다, which means working hard. It’s used in J-hope’s mixtape track, “Base Line,” and BTS’ remake of “Come Back Home.” 
There’s a saying, “Specks when gathered build a huge mountain (a lot of small amounts become a large amount when put together),” which teaches thrift and saving. The young generation, however, realized that it no longer makes sense and started pursuing the pleasure of the present. Park Myeong-su, a famous comedian who’s known for being utterly straightforward, said on a TV show, “specks gathered are still specks.”  
탕진잼 is a slang that can be broken into 탕진 and 잼. 탕진 (tangjin) means squandering, and 잼 (jam) is a shortened form of 재미 (jaemi; fun). It refers to a spending behavior of the young generation to spend all the available fund to get the maximum satisfaction with what they have. The macroeconomic conditions in Korea have been pretty sluggish, and the youth unemployment rate has been historically low. With a very low expectation of the economic conditions or opportunities turning in favor of them, and because “specks gathered are still specks,” young people choose to spend it all. 
This line basically describes how we purchase our present with our future as collateral. S 
tudents receive college education for their future, which ironically is about repaying their student loans. Adults, once they purchase a dream house, need to worry about paying down the mortgage.  
The line is from an idiom “쥐구멍에도 별 들 날 있다 (Even in a mouse hole, there’s a day when the sun shines),” which is similar to “every dog has his day” or “every cloud has a silver lining.” 
“A life with no weekend” is sadly a thing in Korea. A lot of workers and students work/study during the weekend without being able to take a proper rest and enjoy their non-work/non-study life. An interesting thing to note is that they used four 금’s (Fri), which make a 8-day workweek. I don’t think it’s just because it sounds better than three 금’s. The 8-day workweek is actually used to describe works that involve more than 8 work hours per day for 6-7 days per week.  
월화수목금금금 is not a new slang. One of the old songs I can recall is a 2007 song by Dynamic Duo, “출첵 (roll call).” The lyrics are very much in line with Go Go although Dynamic Duo’s song is more like “forget is all and let’s have fun” without any hidden intention/message. 
The above three lines originate from an idiom “밑빠진 독에 물 붓기 (Pouring water into a bottomless jar),” which is similar to “shoveling sand against the tide,” or “pouring water into a sieve.” You think you are saving, but there’s no money accumulated because what you earn is barely enough to afford your living. “Specks gathered are still specks.” 
The above two lines didn’t pass the deliberation for broadcasting (KBS) for using improper word/expression/slang. BTS changed the lyrics to 종이 돼버려 끝내버려, which means “you become a slave, just finish it off.”","

Your corneas will get surprised 
It’s quite cool, it’s quite cool","Background information:
 
Spoon class theory refers to the idea that individuals can be classified into different socioeconomic classes (spoon classes) based on the income or assets of their parents and that one’s success in life depends entirely on being born into a wealthy family. The most commonly talked-about spoon classes are (in hierarchical order): the gold spoon, the silver spoon, the bronze spoon, the dirt spoon. (side note: there’s something called “the diamond spoon class” even above the gold spoons.) BTS, coming from a small entertainment agency in an industry that is dominated and almost governed by few big agencies, has been going through unfair treatments and unnecessary hardships. 
(1)  
(2) 
(3) 
(1) 잘 못 익은 것들 can be undercooked stuff or unripe stuff as 익다 can mean (i) to be cooked and (ii) to ripen. There’s an idiom “벼는 익을수록 고개를 숙인다 (As it ripens, the rice lowers its head),” which is similar to “the nobler, the humbler.” So the undercooked steaks can be interpreted as arrogant and immature people.
(2) 스테끼 (pronounced stekki) is an old Korean pronunciation of steak, which is still used to refer to steak in a cute way or by old generations. An interesting thing to note is that unlike the standard pronunciation of steak, 스테이크 (steikeu), 스테끼 (stekki) sounds similar to 새끼 (saekki) when when pronounced fast. 새끼 means (i) a baby (animal; also can be used to a human to mean a baby when used by parents or grandparents) or (ii) a bugger, jerk, or little shit.
 
(3) 씹다 can mean (i) to chew or (ii) to speak ill of someone.
=> Combining everything, “chewing undercooked steaks repeatedly” can be interpreted as “dissing immature and arrogant jerks (who do not “approve” BTS) multiple times”.

There’s no ticket remaining for our concert 

Word-to-word translation will be “our concert, there never is a grape.” When purchasing concert tickets online in Korea, the remaining seats are colored purple, which makes the seating map look like scattered grapes (if there are available seats). 
[lattat 
]
I do it I do it You’re a ratatouille that tastes bad 
Wordplay: in this context, 고소해 can be (1) sue someone and (2) to be pleased over someone’s misfortune (that the person deserves). So it can also mean “it contents me if you’re jealous.” 
[hwanggeumbit] 
 [sunggong]
 
 [bongsong]
 
[hwanggeubhi] 
[shongshong]
 
shongshong is an onomatopoeic word for running. It’s not a standard word, and it sounds very cute. 
 [bal] 
[mal] 
Reference: 
 as used in RM’s mixtape track, “ 
” (Side note: “Lodi dodi” has been used by many hip hop artists including Korean ones. The first track of Epik High’s first album,  
also uses “lodi dodi.”) 
In Korean it’s actually four letters, not four words. The four letters 사필귀정 (事必歸正) means “things certainly go back to the right status/path.” I changed the translated lyrics to four words because I translated 사필귀정 in four words: right will eventually prevail. 
Aesop’s Fables always end by encouraging good and punishing evil. Right will eventually prevail. 

 
[kkol naji]
Watch closely, that’s how you’ll end up 
 [kollaji]
We taste sharp like cola
Wordpla: (1) When something is refreshing or extremely delightful in a slowly-progressing situation, Koreans say “it feels like a sprite,” which is in line with “we taste sharp like cola). Because 쏘다 can be (2) to sting, (3) to criticize, and (4) to shoot, the line can also be “we diss sharply like cola.”  
 [nollaji]
Your corneas will get surprised
There’s a slang “동공지진 (=동공 (pupil) + 지진 (earthquake)),” which is used to say there’s an earthquake happening in their pupils when s 
omeone is so shocked/bewildered. It seems like they lyrics used 각막 (corneas; gakmak) instead of 동공 (pupils; donggong) because -k sounds stronger/fiercer than -ng.

Your corneas will get surprised 
It’s quite cool, it’s quite cool","Background information:
 
Spoon class theory refers to the idea that individuals can be classified into different socioeconomic classes (spoon classes) based on the income or assets of their parents and that one’s success in life depends entirely on being born into a wealthy family. The most commonly talked-about spoon classes are (in hierarchical order): the gold spoon, the silver spoon, the bronze spoon, the dirt spoon. (side note: there’s something called “the diamond spoon class” even above the gold spoons.) BTS, coming from a small entertainment agency in an industry that is dominated and almost governed by few big agencies, has been going through unfair treatments and unnecessary hardships. 
(1)  
(2) 
(3) 
(1) 잘 못 익은 것들 can be undercooked stuff or unripe stuff as 익다 can mean (i) to be cooked and (ii) to ripen. There’s an idiom “벼는 익을수록 고개를 숙인다 (As it ripens, the rice lowers its head),” which is similar to “the nobler, the humbler.” So the undercooked steaks can be interpreted as arrogant and immature people.
(2) 스테끼 (pronounced stekki) is an old Korean pronunciation of steak, which is still used to refer to steak in a cute way or by old generations. An interesting thing to note is that unlike the standard pronunciation of steak, 스테이크 (steikeu), 스테끼 (stekki) sounds similar to 새끼 (saekki) when when pronounced fast. 새끼 means (i) a baby (animal; also can be used to a human to mean a baby when used by parents or grandparents) or (ii) a bugger, jerk, or little shit.
 
(3) 씹다 can mean (i) to chew or (ii) to speak ill of someone.
=> Combining everything, “chewing undercooked steaks repeatedly” can be interpreted as “dissing immature and arrogant jerks (who do not “approve” BTS) multiple times”.

There’s no ticket remaining for our concert 

Word-to-word translation will be “our concert, there never is a grape.” When purchasing concert tickets online, the remaining seats are colored purple, which makes the seating map look like scattered grapes (if there are available seats). 
[lattat 
]
I do it I do it You’re a ratatouille that tastes bad 
Wordplay: in this context, 고소해 can be (1) sue someone and (2) to be pleased over someone’s misfortune (that the person deserves). So it can also mean “it contents me if you’re jealous.”

 [kollaji]
We taste sharp like cola
Wordpla: (1) When something is refreshing or extremely delightful in a slowly-progressing situation, Koreans say “it feels like a sprite,” which is in line with “we taste sharp like cola). Because 쏘다 can be (2) to sting, (3) to criticize, and (4) to shoot, the line can also be “we diss sharply like cola.”  
 [nollaji]
Your corneas will get surprised
There’s a slang “동공지진 (=동공 (pupil) + 지진 (earthquake)),” which is used to say there’s an earthquake happening in their pupils when s 
omeone is so shocked/bewildered. It seems like they lyrics used 각막 (corneas; gakmak) instead of 동공 (pupils; donggong) because -k sounds stronger/fiercer than -ng.

전하지 못한 진심 (The Truth Untold) Ft. Steve Aoki,Love Yourself 轉 ‘Tear’,5/18/2018,"This garden where loneliness is in full bloom 
Covered with prickly thorns, 
I chained myself to this sandcastle 
What your name is, 
Whether you have anywhere to go, 
Oh could you tell me?

And I know 
that all your warmth is real

bloomed in the garden of loneliness 
I wanted to give it to you

But I know 
that I can’t never ever do so 
that I have to hide myself 
because I’m ugly 
I’m afraid 
I’m miserable

The Korean names for Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto are 천왕성, 해왕성, and 명왕성 where 왕성(王星) means the star of a king. 명왕성 (冥王星) is the star (星) of Hades (冥王), the God of the Dead/Underworld. It seems like the lyricist (RM, presumably) played with how 명 (冥; dark), 명 (名; name), and 명 (命; life) are all pronounced the same. Degraded from a planet to a minor planet in 2005, Pluto lost its name and was assigned with a minor-planet designation 134340 Pluto, i.e. it lost its name (명; 名); taking 명 (冥; dark) out from 명왕성 (冥王星), it becomes 왕성 (王星). Now that the name (명; 名) is taken away, the planet has collapsed (since having a name is an essential to have a meaning to one’s existence; this sentiment has its roots in one of the most famous poems in Korea, The Flower by Kim Choon-soo), the remaining life (명; 命) has no meaning any more. 
Eris is a dwarf planet discovered in 2005 and is more massive than Pluto. The discovery of Eris is essentially what initiated the re-classification of Pluto.

It was the first Kuiper belt object to be discovered. Pluto was discovered by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930 and was originally considered to be the ninth planet from the Sun. After 1992, its status as a planet was questioned following the discovery of several objects of similar size in the Kuiper belt. In 2005, Eris, a dwarf planet in the scattered disc which is 27% more massive than Pluto, was discovered. This led the International Astronomical Union (IAU) to define the term “planet” formally in 2006, during their 26th General Assembly. That definition excluded Pluto and reclassified it as a dwarf planet.

Magic Shop,Love Yourself 轉 ‘Tear’,5/18/2018,"I know that you’re hesitating because, even if you speak your true heart, 
it all comes back as scars 
I won’t say obvious things like ‘cheer up,’ 
but I’ll rather share with you my story 
What did I say, 
I told you that we’d win
 
I couldn’t believe (really) 
that we’d be able to win
 
This miracle that isn’t a miracle,
 
did we make it? 
(No) I was here, 
and you’re the one came to me 
I do believe your galaxy
 
I want to listen to your melody, 
how the stars of your galaxy
 
will embroider your sky 
At the end of my despair, 
I found you at last, don’t forget 
You’re the last reason for me who was standing on the edge of cliff 
Live 
On a day you hate being yourself, on a day you want to disappear forever,
 
let’s build a door in your mind 
Once you open the door and enter, this place will wait for you 
It’s okay to believe Magic Shop that will comfort you 
Drinking a cup of hot tea, 
looking up to the galaxy, 
you’ll be alright oh here it is Magic Shop 
So show me (I’ll show you) 
So show me (I’ll show you) 
So show me (I’ll show you) 
Show you show you 
Like roses when blooming 
Like cherry blossoms when fluttering 
Like morning glories when fading
 
Like that beautiful moment 
I always wanted to become the best 
So I was impatient and anxious 
To compare myself against others became my daily life, 
and my greed, which used to be my weapon, became a leash that chokes me
 
But then, looking back, actually, I 
feel like it’s not that I wanted to become the best 
I wanted to comfort and move your heart 
I want to take away your sorrow and pain 
On a day you hate being yourself, on a day you want to disappear forever, 
let’s build a door in your mind 
Once you open the door and enter, this place will wait for you 
It’s okay to believe Magic Shop that will comfort you 
Drinking a cup of hot tea, 
looking up to the galaxy, 
you’ll be alright oh here it is Magic Shop 
So show me (I’ll show you) 
So show me (I’ll show you) 
So show me (I’ll show you) 
Show you show you 
Would you believe if I told you that I, too, was afraid of everything- 
all the true hearts and all the remaining time 
All your answers are in this place where you found, 
in your galaxy, in your mind
 
You gave me the best of me
 
So you’ll give you the best of you
 
You found me You recognized me
 
You gave me the best of me 
So you’ll give you the best of you 
You’ll find the galaxy inside you 
So show me (I’ll show you) 
So show me (I’ll show you) 
So show me (I’ll show you) 
Show you show you","Reference: RM’s tweet (English translation) 
Reference: RM’s talk during Wings Tour the Final: “Even we could not believe that we’d be able to do this, that we’d succeed.” 
Another way to interpret this line is to read 이 기적 as 이기적, which means selfish. Then the translation becomes ‘the miracle that isn’t selfish’ or ‘the miracle that is made possible because we weren’t selfish’ 
Reference: RM’s tweet 
RM used 은하수 (galaxy) quite a lot in the past (in concerts, in his fancafe posts, on Twitter (English translation), etc.)  In the 3rd Muster, he called the sea of ARMY BOMBs a galaxy and said “Even if this universe and this galaxy expand and grow larger, please don’t think that the distance between our hearts grows farther. Your eyes shine brighter than ARMY BOMBs. We are truly one in this galaxy.” He also used ‘galaxy’ in his mixtape track, ‘I Believe.’ 
Direct translation will be ‘on a day I hate being myself, on a day I want to disappear forever.’ But my interpretation is that BTS is speaking this line in the perspective of ARMY. This makes sense given the context that this song is an invitation for ARMY to Magic Shop where they can comfort their soul and love themselves. 
Reference: the above three lines can be found in J-Hope’s HYYH Pt. 1 thank-you note. 
Reference: lyrics from The Last by Agust D: ‘무기였던 욕심이 되려 날 집어 삼키고 망치며 때론 목줄을 거네 (the greed that used to be my weapon now swallows me, ruins me, and puts a leash around my neck)’ 
During a V Live, RM said (around 35:20) “I’m kind of slow in writing music these days. I’m working on it, though. It was going pretty smoothly for a while, but then currently I’m going through a stagnant phase. So I’m listening to various things to learn what’s good and also reading your letters. Well, but the answer will be inside me after all, right? Your answer is also inside you. You can find it.” 
Reference: ‘Best of Me‘ lyrics- “You got the best of me” 
Reference: RM’s talk during Wings Tour the Final: “Even we made it. You, who recognized us, will surely be able to make it.” ","I know that you’re hesitating because, even if you speak your true heart,

Airplane pt.2,Love Yourself 轉 ‘Tear’,5/18/2018,"An odd kid 
He sang as if he was breathing 
Anywhere was fine 
He only wanted to do music 
Only singing 
The thing that made his heart beat 
Although he walked down the only path 
It’s not easy 
Failure and frustration 
Words that someone gave me after calling me, exhausted, to stop 
You’re a singing star 
You’re a singing star 
But I see no star.. 
After some years passed by 
(We still) Sky high, sky fly, sky dope 
(We still) Same try, same scar, same work 
(We still) Wherever in the world we go, 
(We still) we work in our hotel rooms 
(I still) One day it works out too well, then the next day it’s completely screwed 
(I still) Who should I live as today, Kim Namjoon or RM?

So What,Love Yourself 轉 ‘Tear’,5/18/2018,"Somebody call me right one 
Somebody call me wrong 
I’m not gonna care about it 
Why don’t you do the same 
So what 
Let go 
In a sigh, lots of worries are hiding 
Stop thinking about it You already know it all 
In the middle of the road, in the moment you want to give up, 
Shout out louder  
So what what what 
There’s nothing that works out as I wanted 
There’s even fewer places for me to hide 
It’s already been a while since the dice was rolled 
If you dawdle, you’ll be swept away oh bae 
90% of your worries are an imaginary swamp that you created 
Just go go instead of worrying Don’t get scared cheer up 
Shout it out So what what 
We are we are we are 
Young & wild & free 
Your worries worries without no answer 
Don’t fall into them and stay in them 
Even if you’re in danger on the boundary, 
let’s cut through the wind while laughing and chatting 
Sometimes run like a fool 
With mistakes and in tears, we just go 
So what 
Don’t stop and worry yourself 
It’s good for nothing 
Let go 
Although there’s no answer yet,

Outro: Tear,Love Yourself 轉 ‘Tear’,5/18/2018,"Goodbye, to me, is tear 
Even without my noticing, it comes into bloom around my eyes 
Words that I couldn’t let out now flow 
The lingering love crawls on my face 
For a time, you were my dear 
But now, the beer tastes only bitter 
My heart stained with a belated self-hatred 
gets emptied even by that wind brushing by 
Goodbye that ended up coming to me is what I deserve at the end of my playacting full of lies 
If someone turned back time for me, 
could I maybe have been more honest 
My bare face that only I know, 
and my ugly and humble old friends within myself 
Could you have still loved me with the smile you used to make looking at me 
Forever, stop saying things like forever 
There’s gotta be an end anyway 
if there’s a beginning I don’t wanna listen to that 
Advice that’s too right or too many words of comfort I don’t wanna listen to that 
I was just so scared 
because it felt like maybe I had never loved you at all, not for even once 
Although it’s late, you were sincere, 
only you loved me, 
more 
You’re my tear 
You’re my you’re my tear 
You’re my tear 
You’re my you’re my tear 
You’re my tear 
You’re my you’re my tear 
What more can I say? 
You’re my tear 
We used to walk towards the same place, 
but here becomes our last 
We used to talk about forever, 
but now we mercilessly destroy each other 
I thought we dreamed the same dream, 
but now the dream truly became just a dream 
My heart breaks Please rather burn it 
so that the pain and my lingering love don’t remain at all anymore 
You’re my tear 
You’re my you’re my tear 
You’re my tear  
You’re my you’re my tear  
You’re my fear  
You’re my you’re my fear 
What more can I say? 
You’re my.. 
Goodbye, to me, is T.E.A.R 
A thing like tear is a luxury 
There’s not going to be a thing like a beautiful parting, so please begin now 
Woo take it easy slowly cut out my heart 
Yeah yeah squeeze with your foot the broken pieces of my heart 
So that my lingering feeling, such feeling doesn’t remain anymore, 
burn off my heart that is torn into pieces 
Yeah right it’s there Why are you hesitating 
This is the ending you wanted, so 
I hope you kill me quickly without hesitation 
Woo yeah yeah burn it 
Woo yeah yeah yeah burn it 
Woo yeah yeah yeah burn it 
so that even the burnt ash doesn’t remain 
This is real you, and this is real me 
I’ve now seen the end, and even my resentment doesn’t remain 
I woke up from my sweet dream and close my eyes 
This is real you, and this is real me 
We used to walk towards the same place, 
but here becomes our last 
We used to talk about forever, 
but now we mercilessly destroy each other 
I thought we dreamed the same dream, 
but now the dream truly became just a dream

What we should say, 
we already know 
The answer is set, 
but to answer is always hard 
Why do I shed tears 
Why do I tear it off 
It’s no use for me 
Goodbye, to me, is only there just at those moments (Flashback) 
At the moment a word comes out of your mouth, 
at the moment where our focus becomes irregular, 
At the moment where everything is in danger, 
our end that those two letters presented to us
 
I should have not shed tears I should have not torn it off 
I can’t say things like that 
From now on, I’m with incurable disease of parting 
You’re my beginning and end That is all 
My meeting and my parting  
That was all 
From now on, fear will repeat itself 
Cause by you,

Intro: Serendipity,Love Yourself 承 ‘Her’,9/18/2017,"All this is not a coincidence 
 just because, just by my feeling 
The whole world is different from yesterday 
 just because, just with your joy 
When you called me, 
I became your flower
 
As if we have been waiting, 
we bloom painfully beautifully 
Perhaps it is the providence of the universe 
It just had to be like this 
U know I know 
You’re me, I’m you 
As much as my heart flutters, I’m afraid 
because the destiny keeps getting jealous of us 
As much scared as you are, I’m, too, scared 
When you see me 
When you touch me 
The universe has moved for us 
There wasn’t anything even slightly out of place 
Our happiness has been destined 
Cuz you love me 
And I love you 
You’re my blue mold

everything has been destined 
Just let me love you 
Let me love 
Let me love you

Let me love you","[I know it] 
[It is so] 
The particular sentiment, as explained in the lyrics of 134340, has its roots in one of the most famous poems in Korea, The Flower by Kim Choon-soo. 
Blue mold here refers to penicillin, a type of antibiotic derived from Penicillium fungi.","All this is not a coincidence

Best Of Me,Love Yourself 承 ‘Her’,9/18/2017,"When you say that you love me 
I walk on the sky 
Tell me about forever, just one more time

but why didn’t I know that you are the sea 
What would I do when I’m already speaking in your language 
and breathing your breath 
I’ll be you, you who’s holding me 
I kiss your sword
 
So take my hand right now 
Even I can’t believe myself being like this 
I talked only to myself thousands of times, 
“Don’t leave me”

it it exists, wouldn’t it be you 
I wanted to be gentle waves,
 
but why didn’t I know that you are the sea 
What would I do when I’m already speaking in your language 
and breathing your breath 
 you who’s holding me 
I kiss your sword
 
So  
Even I can’t believe myself being like this 
I talked only to myself thousands of times, 
“Don’t leave me”
 
You got the best of me 
You got the best of me 
It’s not really important whether it’s a dream or the reality 
as long as you are by my side 
Thanks 
Day by day

You got the best of me 
I was raining on the inside 
I was snowing on the inside 
Stop all the unhappiness  
and bring me the heaven 
Don’t say it too easily 
There’s no me without you 
You’re my  
The best of me 
Just have confidence in me 
because that’s all I have wished for 
Though there’s no rule for us, 
there’s a way to love 
Who got the best of me? 
Who got the best of me? 
No ones knows  
You’re the best master of mine

Tell me about forever,  
 
One single sentence is enough for me 
that you’re not going to change, ","When you say that you love me 
just one more time

It’s quite cool, it’s quite cool","Background information:
 
Spoon class theory refers to the idea that individuals can be classified into different socioeconomic classes (spoon classes) based on the income or assets of their parents and that one’s success in life depends entirely on being born into a wealthy family. The most commonly talked-about spoon classes are (in hierarchical order): the gold spoon, the silver spoon, the bronze spoon, the dirt spoon. (side note: there’s something called “the diamond spoon class” even above the gold spoons.) BTS, coming from a small entertainment agency in an industry that is dominated and almost governed by few big agencies, has been going through unfair treatments and unnecessary hardships. 
(1)  
(2) 
(3) 
(1) 잘 못 익은 것들 can be undercooked stuff or unripe stuff as 익다 can mean (i) to be cooked and (ii) to ripen. There’s an idiom “벼는 익을수록 고개를 숙인다 (As it ripens, the rice lowers its head),” which is similar to “the nobler, the humbler.” So the undercooked steaks can be interpreted as arrogant and immature people.
(2) 스테끼 (pronounced stekki) is an old Korean pronunciation of steak, which is still used to refer to steak in a cute way or by old generations. An interesting thing to note is that unlike the standard pronunciation of steak, 스테이크 (steikeu), 스테끼 (stekki) sounds similar to 새끼 (saekki) when when pronounced fast. 새끼 means (i) a baby (animal; also can be used to a human to mean a baby when used by parents or grandparents) or (ii) a bugger, jerk, or little shit.
 
(3) 씹다 can mean (i) to chew or (ii) to speak ill of someone.
=> Combining everything, “chewing undercooked steaks repeatedly” can be interpreted as “dissing immature and arrogant jerks (who do not “approve” BTS) multiple times”.

There’s no ticket remaining for our concert 

Word-to-word translation will be “our concert, there never is a grape.” When purchasing concert tickets online in Korea, the remaining seats are colored purple, which makes the seating map look like scattered grapes (if there are available seats).

I do it I do it You’re a ratatouille that tastes bad 
Wordplay: in this context, 고소해 can be (1) sue someone and (2) to be pleased over someone’s misfortune (that the person deserves). So it can also mean “it contents me if you’re jealous.”

shongshong is an onomatopoeic word for running. It’s not a standard word, and it sounds very cute. 
 [bal] 
[mal] 
Reference: 
 as used in RM’s mixtape track, “ 
” (Side note: “Lodi dodi” has been used by many hip hop artists including Korean ones. The first track of Epik High’s first album,  
also uses “lodi dodi.”) 
In Korean it’s actually four letters, not four words. The four letters 사필귀정 (事必歸正) means “things certainly go back to the right status/path.” I changed the translated lyrics to four words because I translated 사필귀정 in four words: right will eventually prevail. 
Aesop’s Fables always end by encouraging good and punishing evil. Right will eventually prevail. 

 
[kkol naji]
Watch closely, that’s how you’ll end up 
 [kollaji]
We taste sharp like cola
Wordpla: (1) When something is refreshing or extremely delightful in a slowly-progressing situation, Koreans say “it feels like a sprite,” which is in line with “we taste sharp like cola). Because 쏘다 can be (2) to sting, (3) to criticize, and (4) to shoot, the line can also be “we diss sharply like cola.”  
 [nollaji]
Your corneas will get surprised
There’s a slang “동공지진 (=동공 (pupil) + 지진 (earthquake)),” which is used to say there’s an earthquake happening in their pupils when s 
omeone is so shocked/bewildered. It seems like they lyrics used 각막 (corneas; gakmak) instead of 동공 (pupils; donggong) because -k sounds stronger/fiercer than -ng.

Nemo here likely refers to Captain Nemo from Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea. J-Hope also raps “I’m Captain Nemo” in this mixtape track, “Hope World”. The choreography here resembles jump-rope moves, but also reminds me of  
fish flapping its fins, which then reminds me of Nemo from Finding Nemo.

Jiro Ono is a famous Japanese chef who owns a three-Michelin-starred sushi restaurant (Sukiyabashi Jiro). The tasting omakase costs 30,000 JPY. 
열일하다 is a slang (shortened form) of 열심히 일하다, which means working hard. It’s used in J-hope’s mixtape track, “Base Line,” and BTS’ remake of “Come Back Home.” 
There’s a saying, “Specks when gathered build a huge mountain (a lot of small amounts become a large amount when put together),” which teaches thrift and saving. The young generation, however, realized that it no longer makes sense and started pursuing the pleasure of the present. Park Myeong-su, a famous comedian who’s known for being utterly straightforward, said on a TV show, “specks gathered are still specks.”  
탕진잼 is a slang that can be broken into 탕진 and 잼. 탕진 (tangjin) means squandering, and 잼 (jam) is a shortened form of 재미 (jaemi; fun). It refers to a spending behavior of the young generation to spend all the available fund to get the maximum satisfaction with what they have. The macroeconomic conditions in Korea have been pretty sluggish, and the youth unemployment rate has been historically low. With a very low expectation of the economic conditions or opportunities turning in favor of them, and because “specks gathered are still specks,” young people choose to spend it all. 
This line basically describes how we purchase our present with our future as collateral. S 
tudents receive college education for their future, which ironically is about repaying their student loans. Adults, once they purchase a dream house, need to worry about paying down the mortgage.  
The line is from an idiom “쥐구멍에도 별 들 날 있다 (Even in a mouse hole, there’s a day when the sun shines),” which is similar to “every dog has his day” or “every cloud has a silver lining.” 
“A life with no weekend” is sadly a thing in Korea. A lot of workers and students work/study during the weekend without being able to take a proper rest and enjoy their non-work/non-study life. An interesting thing to note is that they used four 금’s (Fri), which make a 8-day workweek. I don’t think it’s just because it sounds better than three 금’s. The 8-day workweek is actually used to describe works that involve more than 8 work hours per day for 6-7 days per week.  
월화수목금금금 is not a new slang. One of the old songs I can recall is a 2007 song by Dynamic Duo, “출첵 (roll call).” The lyrics are very much in line with Go Go although Dynamic Duo’s song is more like “forget is all and let’s have fun” without any hidden intention/message. 
The above three lines originate from an idiom “밑빠진 독에 물 붓기 (Pouring water into a bottomless jar),” which is similar to “shoveling sand against the tide,” or “pouring water into a sieve.” You think you are saving, but there’s no money accumulated because what you earn is barely enough to afford your living. “Specks gathered are still specks.” 
The above two lines didn’t pass the deliberation for broadcasting (KBS) for using improper word/expression/slang. BTS changed the lyrics to 종이 돼버려 끝내버려, which means “you become a slave, just finish it off.”","

피 땀 눈물 (Blood Sweat & Tears),Wings: You Never Walk Alone,2/13/2017,"My blood, sweat, tears, and my last dance 
Take them all away 
My blood, sweat, tears, and my cold breath 
Take them all away 
My blood, sweat, and tears 
My blood, sweat, and tears 
and my body, mind, and soul- 
I know that they are all yours 
This is a spell that will have me punished 
Peaches and cream 
Sweeter than sweet 
Chocolate cheeks 
and chocolate wings 
But your wings are those of a devil 
Before your ‘sweet‘ there’s bitter bitter
 
Kiss me It’s okay even if it hurts, just tighten me quick 
so that I won’t be able to feel the pain anymore 
Baby, it’s okay even if I get drunk Now I drink you up 
deep into my throat, a whiskey called you 
My blood, sweat, tears, and my last dance 
Take them all away 
My blood, sweat, tears, and my cold breath 
Take them all away 
Want it more and more, more and more
 
Want it more, more, more more more more 
Want it more and more, more and more 
Want it more, more, more more more more

First Love,Wings: You Never Walk Alone,2/13/2017,"A brown piano that’s sitting in the corner of my memory 
A brown piano that’s sitting in the corner of my childhood home 
I remember the time 
When the brown piano that’s so much taller than me guided me 
I looked up to you and admired you 
When stroking you with my small fingers 
“I feel so nice, mom I feel so nice” 
My fingers walked on the keys on their own 
Back then I didn’t know the meaning of you 
Back then it felt nice just looking at you 
I remember the time 
Around my grade-school days 
When I became taller than you 
I neglected you who I had adored so much 
The image of you being abandoned with dust piling on your once-shiny keys 
I still didn’t know the meaning of you 
Because you were keeping your place wherever I was 
But I didn’t know that it’d be the last 
“Don’t go away like this”, you say 
“Don’t worry even if I leave 
because you’ll do well on your own 
I remember when I first met you 
Without my noticing, you grew up so much 
Although we’re putting an end to our relationship 
Don’t ever feel sorry for me 
You’ll see me again in any form 
Greet me again then” 
I remember the time 
When I faced you again who I had completely forgotten, when I was about 14, 
the moment of awkwardness was short, and I again caressed you 
I had been gone for a long time, but you accepted me without repulsion 
Without you I’m nothing 
The morning we greeted together after dawn 
Don’t let go of my hand forever 
Because I won’t let go of you either 
I remember the time 
You lived through my late teens with me desperately and passionately 
Yeah, we couldn’t see an inch before us, we cried and we laughed 
Even those moments can stay as memories because I was with you 
Grabbing my crushed shoulder, I said
 
that I really couldn’t do it anymore 
Every time that I wanted to give up, you told me by my side 
Kid, you can really do it 
Yeah yeah, I remember the time 
When I was tired, strayed, and drowned in a pit of despair 
Even though I pushed you away and hated meeting you 
You were always by my side even when I didn’t ask 
So don’t ever let go of my hand 
Because I’m not letting go of you ever again 
My beginning and my end, you are the one who’s going to witness it all

Reflection,Wings: You Never Walk Alone,2/13/2017,"I know 
Every life’s a movie 
We got different stars and stories 
We got different nights and mornings 
Our scenarios ain’t just boring 
I find this movie really fun 
I want to film it well every day  
I want to caress myself  
I want to caress myself  
But you know, sometimes, I really really hate myself 
In fact, quite often, I really hate myself 
When I hate myself so much, I come to Ttukseom
 
I just stand here with the familiar darkness 
People who are smiling, a beer that makes me smile, 
and the fear that gently approaches me and holds my hand 
It’s okay- everyone is in twos and threes, 
it’d be nice if I also had a friend
 
The world is another name for despair 
My height is another diameter of Earth 
I’m my whole happiness and my worries 
They repeat every day, the likes and dislikes directed at myself
 
A friend over there who’s looking over Han river,
 
would we be tied by fate if we brushed past each other? 
Well, we might have brushed past each other in our past life 
Maybe we have bumped into each other countless times
 
In the darkness, people 
look happier than during the day 
Everyone knows where they are supposed to be, 
but only I’m walking idly 
But it still feels more comfortable to be here, blended into the scene 
Ttukseom that swallowed the night 
hands me a completely different world 
I want to be free 
I want to be free from freedom 
because now I’m happy yet unhappy   
I see myself 
at Ttukseom

He’s perceiving the fear (that came to him and held his hand) as a friend that he has to coexist with. He mentions the concept of coexistence often: Positivity and negativity, hope and despair, happiness and unhappiness, etc. In an interview with Yonhap News (Side note: this is the first part of Yonhap News’ three-part series, which I think is one of the best in-depth interviews, part 2 and part 3 have also been translated for your interest. Credit to /u/grk637 for doing most of the part 2 translation.), he mentioned that he tries to become friends with anxiety, knowing that accepting/embracing it is the best he can do.

The above four lines end-rhyme (-reum). 
It is likely that ‘a friend’ is not an actual friend but a random person that he spots. Like RM himself, going to Ttukseom alone (or any other park along Han River, more if it’s at night) is something people do when caught up in thoughts to clear their mind (or think even more) while gazing at the river. 
  
Background information for the above three lines: there’s an idiom “옷깃만 스쳐도 인연,” meaning that “even simply brushing past each other means that the two are tied by fate.” Translated liberally, it becomes something similar to “we’re meant to meet.”","

MAMA,Wings: You Never Walk Alone,2/13/2017,"Time travel to the year of 2006 
Crazy for dancing, I tightened my mom’s belt 
When I indulged in it every day despite my dad’s opposition, 
she didn’t care at all and set a small boat of dream afloat 
But I didn’t know that mom’s big support led us 
not to the shortcut laid out wide and straight 
but to this path of dream with debt 
(Always) Money being the problem, my mother eventually 
(Go away) went to work in a different town 
Mom’s voice that I heard on the phone was clear 
What I remember 
is that mom’s strength that time was a breaking ball for me
 
I made a promise to myself that I must succeed for sure  
and with that one promise, 
I became the son I am now 
Hey mama 
Now you can lean on me, I’m always by your side 
Hey mama 
Because you gave me all you got, because you were my support 
Hey mama 
Now you can trust your son, now you can smile

Hey mama

for realizing your sky-like love only now, mama

Failure is the mother of success, the mother 
I learn such passion and sincerity 
Wanna be wanna be 
Now is the time for me to become an adult 
Because you became a fertilizer to a fresh sprout, 
I’ll be a flower and become the flower path of your own 
You walking on way way way 
Hey mama 
Now you can lean on me, I’m always by your side 
Hey mama 
Because you gave me all you got, because you were my support 
Hey mama 
Now you can trust your son, now you can smile 
Hey mama 
Hey mama 
My breath that you created for me that made me able to feel the world 
You, who I want to hug especially today
 
What else would be higher above the earth  
What else would be wider under the sky
 
Only your hand is a cure-all
 
You’re my own everlasting placebo 
I love mom

Now you can lean on me, I’m always by your side

Breaking ball (baseball term) changes its direction as it moves. 
아들내미 is a cute way to call 아들, which means son. 
Reference: “어머님 은혜 (Mother’s favor),” the lyrics of which are: “Though they say the sky is high, I have another thing that is high. The favor of mother who gave birth and raised me. I think it is higher than the blue sky. Through they say the sea is wide, I have another thing that is wide. The favor of mother who teaches me to be a good human. I think it is wider than the blue sea.” 
The above line is him thanking his mom for giving birth to him and raising him, making him who he is inside and out. 피와 살이 되다 (become blood and flesh) is a metaphor used to describe a hardship/experience that lets a person grow as a human. 
Munheungdong is an area in the city of Gwangju, and Hiddink PC bang is a LAN gaming center named after Guss Hiddink, a football manager who was the manager of the South Korean team around the 2002 World Cup. (He was very popular at the time and became the first-ever person to be given honorary citizenship.) 
The above two lines indicate that J-Hope’s mother worked two jobs to support his dream. 
안고 싶은 (want to hug) and 품 (arms; chest) is an unusual combination because when 품 is used, the speaker/subject is mostly hugged “by” the owner of the arms (품에 안기다). My interpretation is that J-Hope, who were in his moms arms, now grew out of the arms and wants to embrace her in return. Or it could be that I’m thinking too much because 숨 (soom; breath) and 품 (poom; arms) rhyme with each other. It might also just be that he wanted to have the end-rhyme. 
Reference: “어머님 은혜 (Mother’s favor),” again.  
Direct translation of 엄마 손이 약손 will be “mother’s hand is medicine hand.” When a young kid has a stomachache, his mom would lay him down and slowly rub his tummy with her warm hand. There’s also a song that she would sing along. The lyrics vary by regions and families, but it almost always starts with “엄마 손은 약손 (mother’s hand is a medicine hand).”","Time travel to the year of 2006 
Crazy for dancing, I tightened my mom’s belt 
When I indulged in it every day despite my dad’s opposition, 
she didn’t care at all and set a small boat of dream afloat 
 I didn’t know that mom’s big support led us 
not to the shortcut laid out wide and straight 
but to this path of dream with debt 
 Money being the problem, my mother eventually 
 went to work in a different town 
Mom’s voice that I heard on the phone was clear 
What I remember 
is that mom’s strength that time was a breaking ball for me
 
I made a promise to myself that I must succeed for sure  
and with that one promise, 
I became the son I am now 
 
Now you can lean on me, I’m always by your side 
Hey mama 
Because you gave me all you got, because you were my support 
 
Now you can trust your son, now you can smile
 
Hey mama 
Hey mama 
Hey mama 
I’m sorry mama 
for realizing your sky-like love only now,  
Hey mama 
So thanks mama 
for becoming my blood and flesh,  
Remember, ? 
Munheungdong Hiddink PC bang, Broadway restaurant
 
A veteran running around for her family on two feet
 
Failure is the mother of success, the mother 
I learn such passion and sincerity 
Wanna be wanna be 
Now is the time for me to become an adult 
Because you became a fertilizer to a fresh sprout, 
I’ll be a flower and become the flower path of your own 
You walking on way way way 
 
Now you can lean on me, I’m always by your side 
 
Because you gave me all you got, because you were my support 
 
Now you can trust your son, now you can smile 
 
 
My breath that you created for me that made me able to feel the world 
You, who I want to hug especially today
 
What else would be higher above the earth  
What else would be wider under the sky
 
Only your hand is a cure-all
 
You’re my own everlasting  
 
Hey mama 
Now you can lean on me, I’m always by your side

Because you gave me all you got, because you were my support 
 
Now you can trust your son, now you can smile

brr","방송합니다 seems to be a shortened form of “방탄이어서 죄송합니다”, which means “I’m sorry for being Bangtan.” There’s a slang “문송합니다”, a shortened form of “문과여서 죄송합니다 (I’m sorry for being a liberal arts major)”, which made it’s appearance maybe a couple of years ago. It is used (1) when high school students (In Korea, high schools offer different curriculum tracks, and students entering regular high schools have to choose between 문과 (liberal arts) and 이과 (natural science).) who are on the liberal arts track don’t understand what’s supposed to be a common knowledge had they studied science, and (2) when college seniors who majored in humanities experience more difficulties in finding jobs compared to those who majored in science and technology. Korea’s youth unemployment rate has been hitting record high. 
Direct translation: will feel like a dog’s barking sound to somebody bae 
Koreans call someone who is everyone’s favorite punching bag a 동네북 (which gets literally translated to a neighborhood drum).  
사물놀이 (Samulnori) is a percussion music performed with four traditional Korean musical instrument. 
연행 is specifically used when a police officer is taking the suspect in to the police station, therefore making the transition to “all innocent.”  
매듭짓다 (tie a knot in thread) also means to conclude or to wrap up. Because of the lack of clear subject, the above line can also be interpreted as “If I can’t do it, I’ll rather quit. (= I do it right as long as I’m on it.)”  
“You” here are antis condemning BTS online using a mouse.  
I’m pretty sure what he meant by “X쳐” is “족쳐,” which means “to put the screws on someone”. Why did he replace 족 with X? To link it to KAWS toys, whose eyes are X-ed out. 
Brick here is bearbrick. 
뱁새 (Korean crow-tit) stands for an underdog here. 쎈캐 is a slang for a strong character in video games (센 캐릭터). 
(1) There’s an expression “when a shitty car leaves, a Benz arrives,” used to jokingly comfort a someone who broke up with their boyfriend. (2) When someone is so blindly in love that they don’t see/admit any bad things of the person they love, we say a bean hull (콩깍지) has been put on their eyes.  
The above two lines were modified (along with some minor changes in other parts of the song) for KBS Music Festival due to “inappropriate language.” The modified lyrics are “작은 날갯짓이 만든 나비효과 / 이제 진짜 작별인사 / say goodbye can you see me now,” which is translated to “the butterfly effect caused by a little flapping / Now it’s a true farewell / say goodbye can you see me now”","“Name, name!”

“We all are called dogs and pigs (see the quoted background information below). Infuriated, we lose our mind.”  
Also, notice how their choreography features an ‘animal dance’ in the live performance video linked above. 
There’s a Korean phrase “뱁새가 황새 따라가다 가랑이가 찢어진다,” meaning “If a crow-tits tries to follow a stork, it’ll split its legs.” It teaches how you should tailor your ambitions to the measure of your abilities or the resources given to you. BTS often refer themselves as 뱁새 (crow-tits): underdogs, those who started with disadvantages, the powerless in the society, and so on. 황새 (storks) in this context means those who are born with advantages. This line highlights the severe socioeconomic inequality in Korea. 
MAYDAY can also be interpreted as May Day, a celebration of laborers and the working classes (labor day is the first day of May in many countries, including Korea).

봄날 (Spring Day),Wings: You Never Walk Alone,2/13/2017,"I miss you 
Saying this out loud makes me miss you more
 
Though I’m looking at your picture,

us who now became to find it difficult to see each other even for once 
It’s all winter here

please stay there a while longer 
Please stay","Note: The first line 보고 싶다 [pronounced bogoshipda] feels very heavy to me. It’s in the stem form (no conjugation), which means that it is not meant to reach any specific listener. It’s like the longing for “you” grew so strong inside that it got released on its own. This explains the second line “이렇게 말하니까 더 보고 싶다 (Having said it like this, I miss you even more)” since the feeling has now been realized. 
“your” here is plural. 
Movie reference: “8월의 크리스마스 (Christmas in August, 1998),” (one of the classic romance drama films in the Korean film history) 
Movie reference: “時をかける少女 (The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, 2006)” 
Movie reference: “Snowpiercer (2013)” 
This is a departure from the earlier lyrics, “얼마나 기다려야 또 몇 밤을 더 새워야 널 보게 될까 만나게 될까 (how much longer should I wait and how many sleepless nights should I spend before I get to see you, before I get to meet you),” which represents the change of his attitude: rather than hopelessly waiting for “you,” he’s now actively coming for “you”.","I miss you

It seems pretty obvious that the above four Korean lines are inspired by one of the famous quotes by Martin Luther King Jr., “If you can’t fly, then run. If you can’t run, then walk. If you can’t walk, then crawl. But whatever you do, you have to keep moving forward.” The same quote was used backward in A Supplementary Story: You Never Walk Alone. 
뱁새 (baepsae; Korean crow-tits) refers to someone who tries hard to achieve something out of his league. Here it means underdogs who fight hard. 
묻지 마라 can also be interpreted as “don’t bury [us]” instead of “don’t ask.”

Outro: Wings,Wings: You Never Walk Alone,2/13/2017,"Take me to the sky 
Put your hands up to the sky 
Yeah, if you feelin’ the vibe 
Uh, if you’re ready to fly 
Yo J, let’s do it 
I remember my childhood self 
Because I didn’t have many worries, 
that this little feather would become wings 
and that the wings would make me fly 
I was full of the belief and conviction 
along with the sound of laughter
 
Going down the path that others tell not to go, 
doing things that others tell not to do, 
wanting things that are not supposed to be wanted, 
and getting hurt again, hurt again 
You can call me stupid 
then I’ll just smile back 
I don’t want to succeed with something that I don’t want to do 
I push myself 
Word 
I believe myself and that my back’s hurting is 
for the wings to sprout 
I believe you and that though now it seems humble 
in the end you’ll leap into a prosperous future 
Fly, fly up in the sky 
Fly, fly get ’em up high 
This is the path you’ve chosen Kid, don’t get scared 
This is only your first flight uh 
Take me to the sky 
If I could fly away freely 
If I could escape forever 
If my wings could fly 
I fly through the air that gets heavier and heavier 
I fly, I fly, I fly away 
Higher than higher than 
Higher than the sky 
I fly, I fly, I fly away 
With all my strength, 
my wings that are colored red
 
Spread spread spread my wings 
La la la la la la, la la la la la la 
Spread spread spread my wings 
La la la la la la, la la la la la la 
Wings are made to fly fly fly 
Fly fly fly 
If my wings could fly 
Now I know 
I break up with the idea of getting old while regretting 
I chose 
to have an unconditional faith 
It’s time to be brave 
I’m not afraid 
because I believe in myself 
because I’m different from before 
I won’t cry going down the path I chose 
and I won’t hang my head low 
because I’ll be in the sky 
because I’ll be flying fly

La la la la la la, la la la la la la 
Spread spread spread my wings

If my wings could fly","“Because I didn’t have many worries, I was full of the belief and conviction that this little feather would become wings and that the wings would make me fly along with the sound of laughter.”  
 [I’ll spread] 
Red-colored wings can be interpreted in two ways: (1) wings that are rosy, reflecting the sunrise (sunset might be more natural, but this song is about determination and ‘start,’ so I’d rather associate the red with sunrise). (2) Wings that are stained with blood, representing the struggles that BTS had been through and the resulting wounds and bruises.","Take me to the sky

A Supplementary Story: You Never Walk Alone,Wings: You Never Walk Alone,2/13/2017,"Yeah why does God keep 
making us lonely OH NO

are wings towards the light

if I can fly away, I’ll fly

Wordplay: We can’t reach the 정상 (頂上; summit) while being 정상 (正常; normal). 
Notice how 흥 흥 (heung heung) sounds similar to vroom vroom. 
Reference: 
that goes “Ayo Hitman Bang introduces hit it the second audition Knock out your opponent with rap, dance, and singing Do you want a badge called Bangtan? Here I spit rhyme and flow” 
호식 (Hosik) is a nickname of J-Hope (호석; Hoseok). This line can frequently be heard at traditional marketplaces.   
치키차카초 (chikichakacho) is probably taken from  
of a famous Korean animation, 날아라 슈퍼보드 (Fly, Superboard). It’s also similar to 치카치카 (chikachika), which Koreans use to describe the sound/motion of brushing teeth (especially to children).

Intro: Never Mind,The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever,5/2/2016,"I used to run only looking the front 
Without sparing a moment to look around 
Before I knew about it, I had become the pride of my family 
And I had become fairly successful 
The time called adolescence 
I suddenly think of it 
Back then I was young and had nothing to be afraid of 
A few frustrations meant nothing 
The only differences are my height that increased a bit compared to then 
And my view that matured a bit more compared to those of my age 
From a basement studio in Namsandong 
To Apgujeong I laid my beat, the origin of my youth 
Everyone around me told me not to go overboard 
They told me I’d make my whole family go broke if I acted like some musician 
It was then that I stopped caring about whoever said whatever 
I just lived my life the way I wanted, the way I believed 
How do you think I am now? 
How do you think I think I am? 
I’m asking this to those who prayed for my failure 
Do you think I ruined my family, you bastards? 
I don’t give a shit I don’t give a fuck 
Like I said hundreds of times every day 
‘Take your damn attention off me’ 
We can taste failure and hang our head in frustration 
We are still young, so don’t worry about anything at all 
On a stone that doesn’t roll 
Moss grows certainly
 
If there’s no way back, go straight 
Forget about all your mistakes 
Never mind 
It won’t be easy, but have this engraved in your heart 
If you think you’re gonna crash, accelerate even harder, you idiot 
Never mind, never mind 
No matter how thorny the road is, run 
Never mind, never mind 
There’re a lot of things in the world that you can’t control 
You better 
Never mind, Never mind 
If you think you’re gonna crash, accelerate even harder, you idiot 
Never mind, Never mind 
We’re too young to give up, you idiot 
Never mind 
If you think you’re gonna crash, accelerate even harder, you idiot 
If you think you’re gonna crash, accelerate even harder, you idiot 
Never mind","“A rolling stone gathers no moss” in Korea usually means one who diligently endeavors neither settles for the present nor falls behind. “On a stone that doesn’t roll, moss grows certainly” therefore means one who doesn’t consistently try hard will surely lag behind.","I used to run only looking the front

Intro: 화양연화 (Intro: The Most Beautiful Moment in Life),The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever,5/2/2016,"The rim looks farther away today 
My sighs well up on the court 
A boy who’s afraid of the reality 
His heart is at peace only when he’s throwing the ball, 
the ball he throws by himself  
What I throw towards the rim 
are countless thoughts and worries about life 
Though I pretend that I know the world, my body is still not mature 
Shoot! The court is my playground 
With the movement of my hands, the small ball bounces next to my feet  
Though my grades are as low as the floor, even harder I 
shout at the world that it’ll all be fine 
But instead the world scares me   
If you’re going to be scared like that, just stop 
Thoughts that fill my head  
Instead of the ball, I throw my future 
Thanks to the ratings given by others and my inability to meet the standards of success, 
my worries spread once again like cancer god damn it 
With the ball thrown away, I burst into laughter 
My breath, risen up to my chin, is dreams that are squirming 
The dribbles that get faster, and my heart that becomes happier 
Though this moment feels like it’ll last forever, 
once the sun-setting night comes again, it’s the riddled reality 
Once I come to my senses, I get scared again looking at myself being a scared idiot 
The sense of reality that hits me 
Why am I still here while others are running ahead 
Breathe, or dream 
Now row the oars again along the heartbeat 
If you live by pretending that you don’t know, trapped in others’ shallow judgement, 
the sun will set on your life like the court 
What am i doin’ with my life 
This moment will never ever come back 
I ask myself once again, “are you happy now?” 
The answer is already set, “I’m happy”","Word-to-word translation: my grades crawl on the floor

잡아줘 (Hold Me Tight),The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever,5/2/2016,"As I empty my glass, it gets filled up with my longing for you 
I should have lost to you for everything, why did I try to win over you 
Even a trash bag thrown away on the street 
makes a dreary sound in the wind 
All I did was to just paint you over my white canvas 
As I come to my senses, I realize it’s already a beautiful drawing 
You and I are like a cellphone  
When it falls, you know it’ll break. 
Only the smell of you can complete me 
Hold me now 
I see only you 
I see nothing but you 
Look I’m fair and impartial to everyone but you 
Even for a day I can’t do anything without you Please 
Hold me tight Hug me

I pray that I want to see them again

I’m a dead body without you, how would I breathe 
I’m hurt always cry cry cry 
I get crazy, I get tired without you 
I think of you frequently 
I h- hate everything I h- hate everyday 
It makes me cry, ring ding dong 
If I get a chance, I’d hold you 
I’d run, start countdown 
With my mind determined to be pricked by a thorn on rose-like you, I hold you again

고엽 (Autumn Leaves),The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever,5/2/2016,"Like the leaves over there fallen and fluttering, 
helplessly falling, my love is 
Your heart is running only farther away, and I can’t hold you 
I can’t hold you anymore 
I can’t hold you back anymore yeah 
Because those precarious dead leaves over there look like us 
Because they look like they’ll crumble at any slightest touch 
I just gazed at them like the autumn wind 
The way of talking and looking that had already turned cold 
I can see our relationship only being withered away 
Our relationship that is empty like the autumn sky
 
The subtle difference from how it was before 
Tonight that is especially quieter 
One dry leaf hanging on the branch 
is breaking, I can see the thing called “the end” 
Dead leaf that is drying 
The silence in the calmed heart 
Please don’t fall 
Please don’t fall 
The crumbling dead leaf 
I want you who meets my eyes 
I want you who wants me again 
Please don’t get distant 
Please don’t try to fall 
Never, never fall 
Don’t go far far away 
Baby you girl, I can’t let you go 
Baby you girl, I can’t give up on you 
Like the falling dead leaves, 
this love, like the dead leaves, 
Never, never fall 
is withering away 
Like how all dead leaves eventually fall 
Like how all that felt everlasting eventually gets far away 
You’re my fifth season– 
though I try to see you, I can’t see you 
Look, for me you’re still colored in green 
My mind, though I don’t try, travels on its own 
My lingering feeling gets hung piece by piece like wet laundry 
Only the crimson-colored memories fall on my dirty self 
Though I don’t shake my branches, they fall on their own 
Yeah, my love falls in order to rise 
Even when we’re close, my eyes get blind, and we get distant 
I get abandoned like this 
In the memories, I become young again 
Never, never fall yeah 
Never, never fall yeah 
I want you who looks into my eyes 
I want you who wants me again 
Please don’t get distant 
Please don’t try to fall 
Never, never fall 
Don’t go far far away 
Why am I still like this, not being able to givw up on you, 
holding onto our withered memories 
Would this be greed? 
I try to turn back the season that is passing by 
I try to turn it back 
It burns up red in a blaze 
It was all beautiful on our path 
But everything withered away, 
the dead leaves fall like tears, 
the wind blows, and everything gets distant all day 
The rain pours and shatters 
even the last leaf — you you you 
I want you who meets my eyes 
I want you who wants me again 
Please don’t get distant 
Please don’t try to fall 
Never, never fall 
Don’t go far far away

 and 
are shopping malls in Ilsan.  
In a nutshell, 학원 (pronouced ha:gwon) is a for-profit private institution where students (ranging from pre-schoolers to adults) learn a specific subject (school subjects, languages, university entrance exam preparations, and professional exam preparations). Hugok, a town in Ilsan, is where a lot of hagwons are located, attracting students from not only Ilsan but also from north-west Seoul.  
 and small streets around. The zeal for children’s education is pretty high in Ilsan, and RM himself admitted that he went to tens of hagwons growing up. 
Ilsan hosts an international flower festival annually and thus is known for its flowers. Located just off Seoul, there are many flower farms and stores as well. 
아재 (ahjae) is a Gyeongsang province dialect of 아저씨 (ahjussi), meaning middle-aged or married man. 
아지매 (ahjimae) is a Gyeongsang province dialect of 아줌마 (ahjumma), meaning middle-aged or married woman. 
Though my footsteps lead me to the mountains, I’ll be at the peak of Mudeungsan every day
Mudeungsan is a mountain that represents Gwangju, which hosts a national park that is also a UNESCO Global Geopark. 산으로 가다 (going to the mountains) is often used to describe someone’s digressing from the topic/goal. Combining the two, this line could be read “Though I might not walk along the determined path for success, I will succeed.” 
이열치열 (以熱治熱) means to fight heat with heat (there’s also a cold-counterpart, 이한치한 (以寒治寒), fighting coldness with coldness). When it’s hot, people would eat hot food, go to a spa, or drink hot tea to win over the hot weather. Located in the South Jeolla Province, which is in the southwest of the Korean peninsula, it gets pretty hot in summer in Gwangju (I will say, though, Daegu is known for getting the hottest in summer). “I fight against the hot weather with my passion and enthusiasm.” 
Kia Motors has a plant in Gwangju, which is one of the biggest establishments hosted by the city. There’s a strong economic/emotional tie between Kia Motors and the people of Gwangju. Kia Motors also sponsors  
, a professional baseball team based in Gwangju. In the lyrics, KIA is a replacement of gear.

[gieo] 
(1) 호식이 (Hosik-ee) is a nickname of Hoseok (J-Hope), which appeared in the lyrics of  
as well. (2) 기다 (stem form of 기어) means to crawl, but I translated it as to bow.  
Double entendre:
(1) Gather at 7 o’clock (time).
(2) Gather in Gwangju (clock position; geographic location). As you can see from the map, Gwangju is located in the southwest corner of the Korean peninsula (7 o’clock). However, using “7 o’clock” to refer to Gwangju is a subculture slang of a particular online forum,  
, which is a radical right-wing website. Their mocking and making conspiracy theories of Korean democracy in general,  
 and  
, a former President of Korea and a Democratic Party member, generated a lot of social controversies. Gwangju is the home of the May 18 Democratic Uprising (also known as the May 18 Gwangju Democratization Movement or Gwangju Uprising; please refer to ARMY Salon’s summary or this Wikipedia page) and is called the sacred place of Korean democracy. During the period of this democratization movement, the citizens of Gwangju were attacked by government troops sent by the martial law government. The members of Ilbe Storehouse therefore took the military term and call Gwangju “7 o’clock” rather than its name. By calling Gwangju “7 o’clock” by himself, J-Hope is basically criticizing and firing back at Ilbe.
 
(also known as the May 18 Gwangju Democratization Movement or Gwangju Uprising; please refer to  
or 
) 
(Side note since I don’t know when I’ll get to earlier works of BTS: Gyeongsang Province, especially Daegu, is known to be politically conservative, and there’s a political tension and a historical rivalry between Gyeongsang and Jeolla Provinces. Given that four out of seven members are from Gyeongsang Province, it’s interesting (in a good way) to see how J-Hope is showing his Gwangju identity. It’s also worthwhile to mention that Suga composed and produced a tribute, 518-062, before debut.) 
062 is a regional telephone code of Gwangju. 518 refers to the May 18 Democratic Uprising. 
Blue is the color of Samsung Lions, a professional baseball team based in Daegu.

My teacher who’s born as a gold spoon","Background information:  
Spoon class theory refers to the idea that individuals can be classified into different socioeconomic classes (spoon classes) based on the income or assets of their parents and that one’s success in life depends entirely on being born into a wealthy family. The most commonly talked-about spoon classes are (in hierarchical order): the gold spoon, the silver spoon, the bronze spoon, the dirt spoon. (side note: there’s something called “the diamond spoon class” even above the gold spoons.)  
Background information: 
Passion pay refers to low wages (or no wages at all) paid by employers for young workers. The term has been coined from the phenomenon where young and desperate workers accept extremely low wages hoping that their hard work and passion will bring them decent jobs in the future.    
Background information: 
N-po Generation basically means a generation that has given up on N things because of social pressures and economic situations. 
[the rules] 
Seeing that the current young generation suffers from unemployment, lack of future opportunities, economic problems, etc., the old generation often insists that it’s because the young generation does not put enough effort or lacks passion. “Kids these days don’t try hard.” Some tend to think that “kids these days” who grew up without knowing much of the extreme economic problems (like ones they have in the past) are just complaining about little problems that they can overcome had they tried. See 21:40 of this VLive. 
Ah effort effort, ah effort effort
You can clearly hear that 노력 (noryuk; effort) is pronounced as 노오력 (no(n)ooryuk), with the “o” extended. This is not just for a rhythmic effect. From around 2015, being blamed for not exerting enough effort, the young generation started to make self-mocking jokes, “just an effort (노력) is not enough, we need to put an eeeeeffort (노오력).” See 23:25 of this  
or 17:39 of this VLive. 
싹수가 노랗다, literally meaning that the sprout is yellow (rather than green), means that someone has no prospect of future. 노랗구나 (it’s yellow; norahguna) rhymes with 노력 (effort; noryuk).

Dope","Reference: Lee Seung-chul, who was one of the judges in Superstar K4 in 2012, greeted a contestant 
. This soon became a popular meme and even he himself ended up making the title of his showcase “Welcome.” This meme/phrase became huge and is widely used even now.  
쩔다 is a slang that I would translate as something like “freaking awesome.” This slang became to be widely used (at least in Seoul) from around 2006. I’ve been told by some friends from Incheon that Incheon is the origin of this slang. In rare cases, it can also be used to describe something extremely bad, which actually happens in the next line. 
[a jjeol-eo jjeol-eo jjeol-eo uli yeonseubsil ttamn 
] 
Or, alternatively, “Ah drenched, drenched, drenched in sweat, in our practice room”
 
쩔다 here can also be an accentuated version of 절다, which essentially means to soak/marinate something in salt. It can be used to describe someone being completely drenched in sweat (땀에 쩔다) or being totally exhausted due to prolonged work (피곤에 쩔다; drenched in fatigue). It’s used in the following Suga’s verse as well. 
[bwa jjeoleong jjeoleong jjeoleonghan nae chum-i dabhae] 
Notice that his 쩌렁 (jjeoleong; loud and resonant) and 쩔어 (jjeol-eo) rhyme with each other. It’s used in the following Suga’s verse once again. 
[modu bisil-i jjijil-i jjingjjing-i ttilttil-ideul] 
[sseogeogado] 
[morogado] 
 [seonggonggado] 
쩌렁 makes its appearance again. 
Wordplay: Since I like 육포 (肉脯; beef jerky), let me be 6포 (六抛; six giving-up). Both 육포 and 6포 are pronounced yookpo.  
Wordplay: 매도 can be (1) 매도 (賣渡): to sell, or (2) 매도 (罵倒): to denounce, to condemn.  
This reminds me of the title of a 1996 song,  
.  ","Welcome, first time with Bangtan? 
 
If you’re ready, I’ll sing ! 
Unlike the other guys, 
in my style, in my my my own style eh-oh!  
I worked all night  
while you were partying at the club 
Now, don’t be surprised and listen every day 
I got a feel, I got a feel 
I’m pretty dope!
 
Ah terrible, terrible, terrible, the smell of sweat in our practice room 
Look, my loud, loud, loud dance moves respond
 
All the weak, losers, whiners, and idiots 
have nothing to do with me  my hope is dope  
 from head to toe, we’re totally d- dope 
Half of a day, we’re d- drowned in work 
Though we almost live in the studio, and our youth gets rotten, 
thanks to that, no matter which way we go, we run through the freeway of success 
Girls, shout out louder, l- louder 
I worked all night  
while you were partying at the club 
Unlike the other guys, 
I don’t wanna say yes 
I don’t wanna say yes 
Shout out  
so that your body burns out  
 
 
 
Dope! 
I reject rejection 
I’m too cool from the beginning 
Everyone copies me 
Dope 
I reject rejection 
Everyone is my slave 
Everyone copies me 
Dope 
Sampo Generation? Opo Generation?  
Then, since I like beef jerky, let me be Yookpo Generation 
The media and adults say sell us out like stocks, saying that we are weak-minded 
Why do they kill us before we even try? They’re  
Why do you already hang your head? Take this  
Never give up  
The dawn of you and me is more beautiful than the day 
 
Wake up the sleeping youth,  
I worked all night  
while you were partying at the club 
Unlike the other guys, 
I don’t wanna say yes 
I don’t wanna say yes 
Shout out  
so that your body burns out  
 
 
 
Dope! 
I reject rejection 
I’m too cool from the beginning 
Everyone copies me

 refers to the idea that individuals can be classified into different socioeconomic classes (spoon classes) based on the income or assets of their parents and that one’s success in life depends entirely on being born into a wealthy family. The most commonly talked-about spoon classes are (in hierarchical order): the gold spoon, the silver spoon, the bronze spoon, the dirt spoon. (side note: there’s something called “the diamond spoon class” even above the gold spoons.) BTS, coming from a small entertainment agency in an industry that is dominated and almost governed by few big agencies, has been gone through unfair treatments and unnecessary hardships.","It’s burning up

Epilogue: Young Forever,The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever,5/2/2016,"The curtain falls, (I get out of breath) 
and my mind gets complicated (I breathe out) 
Was there any mistake today 
How was the facial expression of the audience 
But I’m happy because I became who I am 
because I can make someone scream out loud 
As I, embracing the yet lingering feelings, 
stand on the empty, still hot, stage 
Standing on the empty, but hot, stage,  
I get scared of the idle emptiness 
In my complicated mind, 
and on the verge of death in life, 
I pretend to be more numb, for no reason 
It’s not even the first time, and I should be used to it by now, 
but even though I try to hide it, I can’t 
When the empty stage is about to cool down, 
I turn away from the audience seats 
I comfort myself now 
I tell myself that a perfect world doesn’t exist 
Gradually, I empty myself 
The huge applause can’t be mine forever 
I talk to myself, shamelessly, 
“Raise your voice, to reach farther” 
Even if there is no everlasting audience, I will sing 
I wish to remain forever as today’s myself 
I wish to remain forever as a boy 
Ah 
Forever we are young 
In the fluttering flower petal rain, 
I wander and run in this maze 
Forever we are young

이사 (Moving On),The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever,5/2/2016,"Ayo SUGA 
Do you remember when we first got here 3 years ago? 
When you and I used to fight each other without any reason 
Wallpaper, bathroom, and veranda were all blue 
Back then I thought this was really a huge house 
But my ambition has grown too big 
A new house that used to look so big now feels so small 
17 pyeong, 9 trainees, when we were small kids
 
It feels like yesterday, but yes, we have grown up 
Everything good was always for someone else 
We would lose our voice worrying about the uncertain future 
We would get choked seeing senior singers perform at year-end award ceremonies 
Let’s not forget but keep those pitiful moments 
This place smells like us 
Let’s not forget this scent wherever we are 
We cried a lot, we laughed a lot, but it all was pretty beautiful 
Nonhyeondong 3rd floor, thank you 
Let’s move 
Goodbye to this place that we became attached to
 
Let’s move 
Now to a higher place 
As taking the last box from the empty room 
I look back for a moment 
Times when we cried and laughed, goodbye now 
3 years felt both short and long 
Many things happened, many memories 
hit me now that we’re about to leave 
The traces left like bank statements and credit cards 
We could get closer to each other thanks to the small house size 
Fight right here we would hit each other a few times   
Maybe that made us develop love and hate toward this place
 
It’s going to be taken away like dust 
There is more stuff than the beginning 
There are more things I own than the beginning 
Now I’m going to take pride and aim at a bigger world, a bigger dream 
A new start, a new beginning 
A time of excitement, thinking how we will decorate again 
Move the boxes, place them, and dust them off 
After we’re done, let’s get a bowl of black bean noodle for our hard work
 
That’s right 
Let’s move 
Goodbye to this place that we became attached to 
Let’s move 
Now to a higher place 
As taking the last box from the empty room 
I look back for a moment 
Times when we cried and laughed, goodbye now 
For the first time in my life in mother’s womb 
I used to count the days until my first moving 
Vague memory, the cost of my moving was 
A machine in my mom’s heart and a big scar 
In the winter of 2010 in Daegu 
A naive and childish me would measure the size of the world 
The cost of my moving into a house called ‘commercial’ 
was people pointing fingers at me blaming that I was following money 
Moving left me many things like this 
Whether or not I liked it, it changed a lot in my life 
My life is about paying monthly rent, I struggle, you know? 
But my pride is to live every day risking the deposit 
So I’m moving again 
I’m about to dream something that is a level higher than just being an idol 
When would be the good day for moving?
 
I hope it’s soon 
Let’s move 
Goodbye to this place that we became attached to 
Let’s move 
Now to a higher place 
As taking the last box from the empty room 
I look back for a moment 
Times when we cried and laughed, goodbye now 
Let’s move 
Goodbye to this place that we became attached to 
Let’s move 
Now to a higher place 
As taking the last box from the empty room 
I look back for a moment 
Times when we cried and laughed, goodbye now 
Everyone’s afraid of changes 
Staying, moving on, staying, moving on 
We keep repeating the same things again and again 
I guess that’s life I’m afraid 
Old or new, new or old, that isn’t really important 
What’s important is that we still breathe and live in the same place 
So let’s move on","17 pyeong is approximately 56 sqm or 605 sqft, there were 9 trainees sharing the house since it was before the members for BTS were fixed to the current 7. 
정 (jeong) is hard to be translated into or be explained in other languages (it’s actually pretty hard to define 정 even in Korean). 정 is a very broad concept of love that includes affection, emotional attachment, sympathy, and compassion. The feeling can be toward humans, animals, and even objects. It also doesn’t have to be absolutely positive. 
정 appears again but this time as a combination of positive and non-positive feeling. 
Having Korean-Chinese delivery food including black bean noodles (jjajangmyeon) while unpacking at the new house is very common on any moving day in Korea. 
Direct translation would be ‘when would be ‘the day without guest’ for this moving’. According to a superstition in Korea, there is an evil spirit, ‘guest’, travelling around and harming people. They are believed to be inactive on certain days. So when people plan moving, wedding, opening of a business, they tend to pick ‘a day without guest’.","Ayo SUGA 
Do you remember when we first got here 3 years ago? 
When you and I used to fight each other without any reason 
Wallpaper, bathroom, and veranda were all blue 
Back then I thought this was really a huge house 
 my ambition has grown too big 
A new house that used to look so big now feels so small 
17 pyeong, 9 trainees, when we were small kids
 
It feels like yesterday, but yes, we have grown up 
Everything good was always for someone else 
We would lose our voice worrying about the uncertain future 
We would get choked seeing senior singers perform at year-end award ceremonies 
Let’s not forget but keep those pitiful moments 
This place smells like us 
Let’s not forget this scent wherever we are 
We cried a lot, we laughed a lot, but it all was pretty beautiful 
Nonhyeondong 3rd floor, thank you 
Let’s move 
Goodbye to this place that we became attached to
 
Let’s move 
Now to a higher place 
As taking the last box from the empty room 
I look back for a moment 
Times when we cried and laughed, goodbye now 
3 years felt both short and long 
Many things happened, many memories 
hit me now that we’re about to leave 
The traces left  bank statements and credit cards 
We could get closer to each other thanks to the small house size 
 we would hit each other a few times   
Maybe that made us develop love and hate toward this place
 
It’s going to be taken away like dust 
There is more stuff than the beginning 
There are more things I own than the beginning 
Now I’m going to take pride and aim at a bigger world, a bigger dream 
A new start, a new beginning 
A time of excitement, thinking how we will decorate again 
Move the boxes, place them, and dust them off 
After we’re done, let’s get a bowl of black bean noodle for our hard work
 
That’s right 
Let’s move 
Goodbye to this place that we became attached to 
Let’s move 
Now to a higher place 
As taking the last box from the empty room 
I look back for a moment 
Times when we cried and laughed, goodbye now 
For the first time in my life in mother’s womb 
I used to count the days until my first moving 
Vague memory, the cost of my moving was 
A machine in my mom’s heart and a big scar 
In the winter of 2010 in Daegu 
A naive and childish me would measure the size of the world 
The cost of my moving into a house called ‘commercial’ 
was people pointing fingers at me blaming that I was following money 
Moving left me many things like this 
Whether or not I liked it, it changed a lot in my life 
My life is about paying monthly rent, I struggle, you know? 
But my pride is to live every day risking the deposit 
So I’m moving again 
I’m about to dream something that is a level higher than just being an idol 
When would be the good day for moving?
 
I hope it’s soon 
Let’s move 
Goodbye to this place that we became attached to 
Let’s move 
Now to a higher place 
As taking the last box from the empty room

Whalien 52,The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever,5/2/2016,"The most lonely creature in the world 
I’m a whale 
Do you wanna know my story? 
I’ve never told this to anybody 
Yeah, c’mon 
In the middle of this wide ocean, 
a whale talks in a low, calm, and lonely voice 
That it can never reach someone else  
no matter how hard it shouts, 
feels so lonely that it closes the mouth 
It’s fine, whatever it is. Now I don’t care 
When this guy called loneliness stays by my side by himself, 
I become completely alone and lock a padlock in solitude
 
Some say, “This kid became almost a celebrity” 
Oh fuck that, yeah whatever, 
it’s fine even if someone’s not able to stay by my side 
Words that are carelessly directed at me soon become a wall 
Even my loneliness is a pretending in your eyes 
Trapped by those walls, 
even if I get suffocated, 
I go towards above that water surface 
Hey oh, oh hey oh yeah 
Lonely lonely lonely whale
 
I sing alone like this 
Could someone like me, who’s like an isolated island, 
shine brightly as well? 
Lonely lonely lonely whale 
I try singing once again like this 
until this song with no reply 
reaches tomorrow 
No more, no more baby  
No more, no more 
This one endless signal  
will reach, someday, 
even the other side of the earth 
No more, no more baby  
No more, no more 
Even the blind whales 
will be able to see me 
Today as well, I sing, yet again 
The world never knows 
how sad I am 
My pain is unmixable 
water and oil 
The attention on me is only there when I breathe above the water surface  
A lonely kid under the ocean 
I, too, want to let the world know 
my value Everyday 
I get motion sickness from my worries 
The sticker is always behind my ear
 
Never end,  
Why is there never an end but only a hell every time 
Even if time passes, 
The Neverland in the cold abyss 
But I always think, 
even if I sleep curled up like a shrimp now, that I must dream like a whale 
The praise that will come one day 
will make me dance every day 
like me, Ye I’m swimmin’ 
I go towards my future 
I believe in the blue sea and my hertz 
Hey oh, oh hey oh yeah 
Lonely lonely lonely whale 
I sing alone like this 
Could someone like me, who’s like an isolated island,

Lonely lonely lonely whale 
I try singing once again like this 
until this song with no reply 
reaches tomorrow 
Mom said that the ocean is blue 
She told me to raise my voice  
with all my strength to reach farther 
But what should I do? 
This place is too dark 
and full of other whales that speak other languages  
I juss can’t hold it ma  
I want to say I love you 
A round that I sing alone 
I run over the same music sheet 
This ocean is too deep 
But I’m still fortunate 
(since no one will know even if I cry) 
I’m a whalien

Intro: What am I to You,Dark & Wild,8/20/2014,"Come here I’m bout to take u higher 
We about to set this love on fire 
I’ve never felt like this before 
Even my mom couldn’t stop me 
I told you how I truly felt about you  
and, in the end, I won 
Baby u should know u change 
all of my negatives to positive 
Though you’re putting up your thorns,  
I can see that you’re a rose 
You might not know yet that you are the one who makes my heart race again, 
but I’ll make sure to know all about you 
I- I want to be y- your oppa 
Different from those scrubs, I want your affirmation 
Though it might sound like a typical movie line, I’m like The Sixth Sense 
Yo I’ll be different I’ll be missin 
I’ll be kissin ya all the time girl 
Though I try taking my eyes off you, I can’t take my heart off you 
Yeah, now is the beginning. I’m yo Pocket Monster 
You gave me your heart, and I gave you all of mine 
Today became happier than yesterday  
But then, why 
But then, why 
I keep finding excuses to contact you as if I’ve done something wrong 
It’s worse than before we started dating 
Maybe me being your boyfriend doesn’t make enough of a reason 
Every time– short answers, “K”, “I’m going to bed”, “no” 
Your messages don’t go over 10 bytes 
You’re a goalie without determination 
And I’m Messi running across the empty field 
Yeah, I knew from the beginning that this wouldn’t be a fair game 
It’s not that I wanted to defeat you, but I also didn’t want to be defeated all the time 
A bit sweetly, 
though we might not be happy lovebirds, 
with our arms tightly linked as other couples would do, 
sometimes with words of comfort and honesty, 
to be for each other 
I can understand that you are dry and dull 
Because I always stand under you, under-stand 
I, holding you up like a wooden horse, 
can’t do anything 
that my awkward smile became a habit 
You again say that you don’t like it but also don’t hate it 
Am I going ahead of you? I wouldn’t do anything you don’t want 
My one-sided love with a lover 
I want to a reckless love without calculation 
Please hold me 
It feels just like a tug-of-war with no opponent 
what you say 
Aah baby don’t you play 
Even if you’re a path covered with fire, I will firmly walk on you 
So please don’t look at me as if I’m someone you don’t know 
because it keeps reminding me of the days when I meant nothing to you 
What am I to you girl what am I to you 
I do love you crazy uh do you? 
Blowing hot and cold, stop confusing a person’s feelings 
If you’ll keep being like this, let’s just sign a contract 
How many kisses a day and how many messages a day 
Yeah, would I feel a bit better if we go that far 
What am I to you girl what am I to you 
I do love you crazy uh do you?","The Sixth Sense is a movie known for its dramatic plot twist. RM is emphasizing how he is different from other guys.

Wordplay: 밖에 can be a postposition meaning “only” or a combination of a noun (밖, the outside) and a postposition (에, at/on/in). Therefore a direct translation would be “I have only you, but why do I feel like you’re outside.”

Movie reference:  
Wordplay: 심해 can be (1) a variation of 심하다 (verb; is too much, is too serious), or (2) 심해 (深海; deep sea). 
Wordplay: 문화재 (文化財; cultural asset) has two types: 유형 (有形; tangible; buildings, books, drawings, etc.) and 무형 (無形; intangible; dance, music, craft techniques, etc.), where 형 (形) means a format. By writing 미형 (美形) 문화재, he means to say “the beauty type” cultural asset. ","Thank you so much for existing

힙합성애자 (Hip Hop Phile / Hip Hop Lover),Dark & Wild,8/20/2014,"It was a new world 
To me who would normally scribble just stories or poems, 
like Sim Cheong, it suddenly came 
and made me open the new eyes of mine that I couldn’t open 
But people keep askin’ baby 
why you love that HIPHOP shit?
 
Then I say, “There’s no reason from the beginning cause it’s HIPHOP“ 
There’s nothing special– Epik High, and like others, Jay-Z and Nas, 
and of course, the classics– Illmatic, Doggystyle, In My Mind, and KRS-ONE, 
and Ready to die, Eminem, The Chronic, and the next masterpiece 2001  
Gang Starr, Black Star, Eric B, Rakim, Pete Rock and CL Smooth 
They juss keep poppin 
I listened to them all the time 
Back then, I was an old lady 
I had so much to say that the stories told by others were not enough 
I first just put layers and layers of nonsense and lies and called them lyrics 
And that was it! uh that was it, that was when I became myself 
On a blank sheet of paper between the pages of my studybook, I put myself that everyone knew 
And then I erased it, I emptied it 
I’m free at least when I’m on the beat 
7 years ago or now, I’m the same, this is the most me 
I’ll be down for your rap 
I’ll be down for your rhythm 
It still makes my heart beat 
It makes me be my true self 
Yeah I love this

(Hip! Hop!) that has now become a part of my life 
(Hip! Hop!)  
Yeah this ma (Hip! Hop!) 
Yo how did I start learning ma Hiphop? I got into it by feeling it with my body 
Boogaloo, King Tut, Old School, I rode the rhythm 
Thanks to BitHit’s trust, I stuck my tongue to the rhyme 
I stood out and now I’m in the intersection of rap and dance 
Yeah ma role model,  
,  
with  
Writing the  
 of my clumsy self, break out from my nameless self and  
 over the stage 
The artists who rang my heart raised me up who knew nothing, ring 
,  
, and  
, who I could express only with my body  
I learned more about myself, uh 
Hope hope world, before I built my own world, there was  
 world 
When he lit up Friday night,  
I became more inspired to write my own music 
Mac Miller, Kanye, Kendrick, their music hits my ears 
The best musicians in my life that shaped the frame so I can go crazier every day 
Endless diction, all right, my instincts choose  
Whatever rap it is, whatever dance it is, my sensuous communication 
Now the space within my life melts in hip hop 
Wild for the night today as well 
My body feels like A$AP A$AP 
I’ll be down for your rap 
I’ll be down for your rhythm 
It still makes my heart beat 
It makes me be my true self 
Yeah I love this

Hip hop came to me gently 
Like a little child looks for his mother, 
it naturally permeated into my life 
I, who was only an elementary school student at the time, 
tailored my dream only then 
I want a rapstar 
A mature kid who loathed a life that is similar to everyone else’s 
Though everyone around me held me back and dissuaded me 
Hip hop, settled itself inside me,  
completely shook me, me who was so young 
My 16 bars that I wrote down on the corner of my textbook pages 
Thanks to them, I declined a stable life and threw myself into a studio in Namsandong, Daegu 
I sharpened the blunt nib of my pen all night 
At the end of my efforts, finally, 
Thanks to the rhymes that I filled my notes with instead of receiving grades for Korean, math, and English that others would do in school days
 Korean, math, and English are considered the three most basic subjects in Korean high schools that everyone takes regardless of their curriculum track. 
 
dreams come true 
Everyone around me asks me, “What is hip hop?” 
I answer with pride, “It’s my everything” 
As a result, I buried my life itself in music 
If loving this culture was a sin, I would have died hundreds of times 
I’ll be down for your rap 
I’ll be down for your rhythm 
It still makes my heart beat 
It makes me be my true self 
Yeah I love this

Let Me Know,Dark & Wild,8/20/2014,"On this melody that has ended, 
I’m enduring by myself 
Now, tell me 
That it’s over, let me know 
Every second, raindrop falls and wells up around my eyes 
You well up 
Even when I just breathe, I see you 
Perhaps it’s true that love blooms like cherry blossoms and wither away easily 
As if it was a dream, we burned like a flame yet only the ashes are left 
Hey girl, I know the conclusion that you made by yourself 
On the melody where your hands, your body, and even your warmth that was hotter than the equator disappeared 
I keep coming back to the same place, stuck between the repeat signs 
On the music score where the final bar line has been marked, I’m circling around by myself 
On this melody that has ended, 
I’m enduring by myself 
Now, tell me 
That it’s over, let me know 
Girl let me know 
Girl let me know 
Though I know that everything is already over 
So that my feeling doesn’t linger on 
Girl let me know 
Girl let me know 
Girl let me know, please say anything 
I just wanna know 
I just wanna know 
My lingering feeling is withstanding in front of the final bar line  
So please say anything to me, girl let me know 
Where did the promises we made to each other go 
They disappeared along with time 
The dominoes that fell as a result of our parting 
are like Juliet and Romeo 
Perhaps I loved you too burningly 
that the heat between the two of us can’t cool down 
I look back only now at the memories with you  
I think of you already, wondering what you are doing 
You take away the stars of my night, you take away the sun of my day 
And the only thing that eventually remained is the darkness of a cold cloud 
Yeah, the rule that says where there’s a hello, there’s a goodbye 
Never ever 
Whatever that rule is, I want to disobey it 
I turn away from it 
I hypnotize myself

Perhaps we are all stupid fools 
We all carry inside our heart a love that has already ended 
It’s not that I still have a feeling for you 
I also know that we can’t be together again 
But sometimes, like I have an upset stomach, like something is stuck in my chest again, 
why does my feeling suddenly explode from inside and make me throw up 
In my imagination, I fight with you, I make up with you, and I understand you 
Your hand gestures and your way of looking at me– they are blurry, but why wouldn’t they disappear 
Why wouldn’t they disappear, why 
Why wouldn’t they disappear, why 
Why wouldn’t they disappear, why

Rain,Dark & Wild,8/20/2014,"(Above Seoul of a deep color in the rain) 
Racing cars, gently shaking umbrellas here and there 
Cloudy sky, clear air 
(Reflected in the puddle formed by now-stopped rain,) 
why did I, with a light gray background, pause to stand here 
I don’t know if I have a lot of thoughts or no thoughts at all 
When it’s about to get bright outside, I wake up from my sleep 
With my exhausted hands, I keep brushing over my hair 
The memo pad of a song that I couldn’t complete last night 
“I’ll finish it today” I shut my eyes tight and let out a deep sigh  
“How should I make excuses?” I try to make something up 
I couldn’t do it anyway, so I might as well just make something up and send it 
As I turned my eyes, it’s fully colored in gray outside the window 
A gray building in a gray city, the gray rain on a gray road  
Everything in this world is slow 
My younger brother, awakened from his sleep, keeps slurring his words at the end
 
I again open and close the innocent refrigerator 
With the unknown empty feeling washing over me, 
I think that I should just go outside 
without even an umbrella 
The sound of rain touching the world feels vivid 
I put on a brief smile at the best background music 
I hum like a crazy guy 
I wonder what time it is 
Above Seoul of a deep color in the rain 
I, still not being able to fall asleep, fade away 
Reflected in the puddle formed by now-stopped rain, 
I, looking even more miserable today, am drawn on the water 
The rain that knocks on my window in a rainy night hits my heart 
A text that I read, holding my sore shoulder, “How are you these days?” 
The text from a friend makes me soaked in emotion 
Smelling the scent of the wet rain, 
I stretch my body, go to the bathroom, 
say hello to myself, half-asleep, in the mirror, 
and take a longer shower even though I have no one to meet 
It still rains outside the house
 
With nowhere in particular to go, with an umbrella, 
I plod along without a set destination 
The rain makes its mark on my dirty shoes as if it’s letting me know its existence 
Would I be someone who left a mark on you like the rain like this? 
If not, would I be someone who just comes and goes like a sudden shower? 
Above Seoul of a deep color in the rain 
I, still not being able to fall asleep, fade away 
Reflected in the puddle formed by now-stopped rain, 
I, looking even more miserable today, am drawn on the water 
When I look outside the window as I heave myself up and feel sore, 
It’s raining as if it knew how my body would feel 
I feel, as I see the raindrops gathered on the window, 
that they are like teardrops flowing down in my heart 
Putting the subtleness behind, I look outside where it looks like my situation 
Everyone is andante in the rain falling like a melody 
I get ready and go outside, opening up the umbrella that was as wrinkled as my face 
As I walk, listening to the rain, 
I wonder who this rain is falling for 
The sound of the rain touching the lonely gray cement stimulates my sense of hearing 
Come slow down 
Above Seoul of a deep color in the rain 
I, still not being able to fall asleep, fade away 
Reflected in the puddle formed by now-stopped rain, 
I, looking even more miserable today, am drawn on the water 
I, even when this rain stops, even when the clouds clear, 
am standing still just like how I am now 
Without saying anything, I look down at the world 
There, a not-so-beautiful me is looking at me","동생 is a younger sibling, or any friend who is younger. I translated 동생 as brother followed by ‘his,’ where the brother is a friend who’s younger (e.g. Jimin, V, and Jungkook) because I’m imagining the background of this scene to be BTS’ house. However, considering that RM has a younger sister, this could also be translated as “my younger sister, awakened from her sleep, keeps slurring her words at the end.” 
House here is the dorm where BTS members live together.","(Above Seoul of a deep color in the rain)

BTS Cypher PT.3 : KILLER,Dark & Wild,8/20/2014,"Whatever you do, I will kill for 
Whatever I do, I’ll be real for 
Look carefully, this exactly is the beast mode you wanted  
When men smoke cigarettes, and women cheat* 
I smoke beat this a beat smoke
 
Who the man told you crazy 
Who the fella told you crazy 
I’m better than ya lazy 
I live a hundred times harder than those bastards who do hip hop with their keyboards 
“Rap = an easy genre,” too many generals  
A ragtag bunch of nobodies, you should get some manners 
Why do these incompetents who cannot even a verse 
try to discuss rap or music 
That’s how everyone here raps the same like this even now  
They can only say three or two letters at a time 
Everyone is a critical patient 
Motherfather, aphasics, all those con men 
Back yourself and look at the mirror 
If you’re going to bring something, be original, suckers 
You put zero efforts 
I go by the name of monster 
welcome to the monster plaza 
This a cypher im a rider imma 
ride it like a biker 
Oh, shush, play it backward, beat 
You’re a sewer, and I’m savory
 
The kids whose abilities are on strike 
put on a protest so hard behind my back  
Man what you afraid of, I’m not afraid of anything on the beat 
All your pockets are empty, and even your barely-existing abilities are poor 
I don’t need GIVENCHY, cuz im a star 
I don’t need HUGO, already a boss 
I’m not a Buddha, but I’m a butcher, shaving your flesh like a 
Change your iPhone 
You dont need your airplane mode 
Just my roaming charges are hundreds of dollars 
And you know I can take it more 
Make money with your sloppy skills, just sell your clumsy skills, you quacks 
San paulo to Stockholm 
On the seats you guys will never be able to reach, I sit 
There are many haters 
But no problem, I kill 
Shoveling my career to bury me 
But I don’t care 
You can’t control my shit 
I came back as a ninja who overcame the distrust 
This fourth album, a full view, Cypher 
When this track plays, haters go completely silent  
In this scene that is illegitimate, this song is a legit trap 
Everyone will fall into it every day 
Hang hang over bang 
The swag explodes 
Wherever I’m headed to, I go straight 
Wherever I go, there are all those hip hop losers 
Our positions are proportional, you should be too busy to slander me  
But I felt a bite, bait 
All the girls call me, beeper
Original Korean lyrics use 언니 (unnie), which is used by females to call/address an older female. It is, however, common that night club barkers (even if they are males) call female customers unnies. The use of unnie thus makes sense here. 삐삐  is a pager/beeper, so it could be (1) “all the girls, call me, page me.” Or, since bbi- is commonly used as an onomatopoeia of censoring sounds, it could also be (2) “all the girls call me ‘XX’,” where XX is some unknown word. 
 
Who dare to swear at me 
Tell them to look at their own situation and come back 
I’ve got everything I want, tell them to look at me 
Oh, I’m on top of the beat beat, wiggle wiggling, jingle jingling  
roll rolling, beagle beagling 
And my power that blazes, blazing 
The god who owns rules the ring, ring, now, now, the king who’ll list his name up there 
This is just for tasting, still a snack 
My rap is a Korean meal that fills your stomach 
Yeah, my country, Korea 
All those rap pigeons babbling sloppy English should look

 
who’s standing above you, What 
There are many haters 
But no problem, I kill 
Shoveling my career to bury me 
But I don’t care 
You can’t control my shit 
I came back as a ninja who overcame the distrust 
SUGA a.k.a Agust D, my second name 
When I walk the streets, people talk my name in whispers 
My beat that I laid from Daegu to Apgujeong  
My music that breathes alive in every corner of the world 
I’m a baby shaman that dancing barefoot on the swords called beat, that’s me 
Do you know that half of what I look on TV is a shadow warrior?

 
Even if you act with bravado using your three-inch tongue, 
that’s just rap-touting 
Aimed at those stupid lazy asses,

Even if you attack me with petty words like that, 
I only become stronger, a mystery 
I’m a starfish that grows up on your jealousy

Hyungnims who aged immaturely 
To my standards, you’re also at the level of babies 
Whether or not I’m a wack or a fake 
Whether it is this or that, I’m the new standard of the pop music scene 
This rap slaps the old bastards’ ears like a storm 
chop chop chop 
There are many haters 
But no problem, I kill 
Shoveling my career to bury me 
But I don’t care

I came back as a ninja who overcame the distrust","1) To have an affair or to cheat in Korean is 바람피우다 (barampiwooda). To smoke cigarettes is 담배를 (담배(dambae; cigarette)+를(reul; object particle)) 피우다 (piwooda; to smoke). RM separated 바람피우다 into two parts, 바람 (baram; wind) and 피우다, so that it shares “피우다” with smoking cigarettes. This line also rhymes with the next English line. “When men smoke cigarettes, and women smoke wind (=cheat), I smoke beat. This is a beat smoke.”
2) This line became controversial because of how it depicts women. There were opinions that the line makes it seem equally likely for men to smoke and women to cheat. In 2017, RM changed the lyrics to “누구는 담배, 누구는 바람필 때,” meaning “when some smoke, and some other cheat.” 
Notice how 쉿 (shush) is pronounced “shit” 
[neon hasugu nan gusuhaji]
You’re a sewer, and I’m savory
Wordplay: 하수구 means sewer but, broken into 하수 and 구 with 구 being a misspell of 고, it can also mean a person who lacks skills or someone who is a puppet. Hence the line can also be interpreted as “You’re a bad player, and I’m savory (pleasant to hear).” 
(Or, “you’re a beggar, all your pockets are empty, and even your barely-existing abilities are poor) 
Buddha in Korean is 부처(bucheo), which rhymes with butcher 
돌팔이 (dolpari; a quack) originates from 돌다 (to roam, to circle around) and 팔다 (to sell), which used to mean a roaming merchant when combined. Nowadays 돌팔이 is used to describe someone who is not qualified to do something yet claims the opposite. Since 돌 (dol) itself means a stone/rock, the Korean lyrics literally go: “Make money with a stone, just sell your stones, you quacks.”  
Wordplay: 삽질 (sapjil; shoveling) is a widely used slang to describe some action that is pointless. Those the haters attack my career to bury me, they’re actually just wasting their time. 
Dark & Wild is BTS’ debut studio album (regular, full-length album). 2 Cool 4 Skool, O!RUL8,2?, and Skool Luv Affair were all EP (Extended Play) album. 
(bbikki) 
삐끼 (bbikki) is a slang for a night club barker. The use of 삐끼 instead of 미끼 (mikki; bait) allows 입질 왔다 (the fish bit the bait) to have another meaning, which is to feel the good chance coming. 
(bbibbi) 
Original Korean lyrics use 언니 (unnie), which is used by females to call/address an older female. It is, however, common that night club barkers (even if they are males) call female customers unnies. The use of unnie thus makes sense here. 삐삐 (bbibbi) is a pager/beeper, so it could be (1) “all the girls, call me, page me.” Or, since bbi- is commonly used as an onomatopoeia of censoring sounds, it could also be (2) “all the girls call me ‘XX’,” where XX is some unknown word.  
The dog breed beagle is often used to describe someone who is extremely cheerful, energetic, and playful.

 (mansigideul) 
만식이 (mansigi) is an old slang that has been used in clothing markets by shop owners. Customers who know nothing of the ways of the market (prices, how to negotiate, etc.) and are therefore extremely gullible are called 만식이.   
かげむしゃ (kagemusha) is a political decoy, employed by a busho (a Japanese military commander) as his straw man. The line therefore means half of what he is on TV is fake. 
세치 혀 (three-inch tongue) has a negative connotation; it is usually used when someone uses their words to fool or attack someone. 
뺑끼 (bbaengkki) is a slang that originates from “feint.” It is used when someone fools others as if they are doing what they are supposed to do when in fact they are not. 
The “flow job” makes you think of blow job 
극딜 (geukdil) is a slang that is a combination of 극(geuk; 極; extreme) and damage “deal”ing (an online game terminology meaning a full-scale attack carried out to damage the opponent).  
(bulgasaui) 
(bulgasari) 
To send someone to Hong Kong is a slang that means to make someone feel orgasm. 
Instead of 형님 (hyungnim), he used 행님 (haengnim), a satoori of 형님.","Whatever you do,

I’m not a Buddha, , shaving your flesh

Everyone will fall into it every day 
Hang hang over bang 
The swag explodes

Wherever I go, there are all those hip hop losers 
Our positions are proportional, you should be too to slander me

이불킥 (Embarrassed),Dark & Wild,8/20/2014,"(One, two, three, four) 
I do all sorts of things, I might become a tree 
Why do I keep becoming weird in front you 
I’m not even a pre-school kid, but everything I do is so childish 
Actually, I’m a bit more childish than the pun I just made 
Look at my eyes 
My mischievous words are not what I really mean 
Saying this one thing was so hard, “I’m interested in you” 
Though I became a cold moon because I was embarrassed to become a sun, 
after then, I kept making blanket waves on the sea that is my bed 
(Splash! splash!) 
My achievement is to convert my embarrassment to UFC while jumping up and down like a crazy guy 
Giving a swift high kick, 
throwing jabs and hooks, 
pounding, 
and venting it all out again while clutching my blanket 
Oh, give me an iron to straighten my fingers and toes 
Oh, you already mean more than a few lines of lyrics to me 
But, what did my blanket do wrong, pay for it 
I just wish you were here 
Only you only you 
I cannot but act awkwardly in front of you again 
You’re so pretty, pretty, pretty 
Oh, why did I do so 
I might kick my blanket while I’m asleep 
Only you woo woo woo woo woo (you!)

To me, it’s only you 
Only You 
Though my eyes turn from your eyes, nose, and to lips, 
please don’t misunderstand me 
I can’t control myself when I see you 
I’m really acting silly 
Holding my breath, I say, “‘cheers’ instead of water” 
I’m even not drunk, but I act cute, pretending I’m drunk 
I’m not even a pencil, I keep getting dark thoughts about you 
Could it be that you’ve already noticed my dark thoughts? 
I try to hide my real thoughts, but it doesn’t work and I just rub my face 
Time flies without my knowing, tik tok 
When we got to your house, 
I set the mood 
and hold your shoulders, thinking I’ll really pretend I’m crazy and do a deep kiss 
But the phone rings right then 
Your dad angrily asks you when you’re coming home 
Oh my god, the mood was so good 
I vent my anger on my innocent blanket before bed 
It was so good.. 
Only you only you

You’re so pretty, pretty, pretty

Should I do it or not, then I did it

But my arrow keeps missing the target that is you 
Where would it be, would your heart be there? 
Ah, why did I do so back then

Only You","이불킥 is a slang that is a combination of 이불 (ibul; blanket) and 킥 (kick). You do something embarrassing or cringey during the day, go to bed at night, and cover yourself with bedclothes.

Everyday is a Sunday for me these days- Sunday when the sun called you is up 
24/7 I only thought about you all day 
The first date that I’ve been looking forward to 
For no reason, I feel like it’s going to be a special day for me

For tonight at least, I’ll be a Plan Man. It’s for you, darling 
If time is a stock called you, I’d invest 
To choose the clothes to wear when meeting you, I besiege my closet

우쭈쭈 is an onomatopoeia that mimics someone comforting a baby (or a cute person, usually a lover). 그랬쪄 is a variation (with a lot of aegyo) of 그랬어, which means “did you feel so,” “did that happen,” or “did you do so,” used when someone agreeing enthusiastically (the content doesn’t really matter) to a baby or a cute person.","Af first, it was just out of curiosity

I haven’t really changed, baby, a second grader in the pop music scene 
I’m still 181cm, baby, it’s only the height of my mind that grew  
I’m the top of my class in a way, baby, I received a rookie award as well 
Walking around along the hallway, I get greetings from new juniors as well 
Now I feel like I know stuff 
I do rehearsals skillfully 
Having juniors by a year, I feel like I’m riding high now 
Ahhh, shush 
Uh.. but then, in front of my eyes, there are seniors in their fifth and sixth years

Only then I feel that I’ve got a long way to go now

prejudice, hateful comments, double standards, swearing, and indifference

Outro : 그게 말이 돼? (Outro : Do You Think It Makes Sense?),Dark & Wild,8/20/2014,"I rewind my girl baby come back to my world 
I rewind my girl come back 
I rewind my girl baby come back to my world 
I rewind my girl come back 
Does it make sense? Do you think it makes sense 
that our love would change so easily like this 
Though I meet you so that no one knows, so that it looks as if everything’s fine, 
I’m crying now just looking at your facial expression 
Explain it, explain it, explain it girl 
My baby explain it, explain it  
Though I hate you so much,  
I can’t help but think of you even now 
Love is not over, it doesn’t make sense 
Story is not over, it doesn’t make sense 
Talk is not over, it doesn’t make sense still 
Problem is not over, it doesn’t make sense 
The way you look at me that took my breath away 
Your finger that held me, that pale, white finger 
It felt like they would last forever, 
but as time passed by, you became different 
Your words and facial expression that became too cold

For the second reason, it is not uncommon that a boyfriend is called “oppa” by his girlfriend when he is older than her.

Around 2012, a comedian used a satoori phrase “궁디를 주 차삐까? (Shall I kick you in the butt)” on a popular comedy show, and it quickly became a buzzword. Although it sounds pretty violent, it’s more like an exaggerated version of “do you want to be scolded/punished?” and it almost never actually leads to any action.  
거시기 (geosigi) is a magical word that can be anything and everything. It can be a noun, pronoun, adjective, adverb, verb, or, really, anything. There is no equivalent word in standard Korean. Here, “거시기 거시기 해?” could be (1) “do you feel weird because you like me?” or (2) “Do you have a particular feeling towards me?” (or, anything else).","Girl, where are you from?

하루만 (Just One Day),Skool Luv Affair,2/12/2014,"Just for one day, if I have time, 
I would like to sleep like a baby, drunk in your sweet scent 
Out of my packed schedule, if there is an opportunity, 
I would like to lay myself in your warm, deep eyes 
I like that, when you tie up your long, long straight hair, 
your breathtaking neck and strands of hair flowing down 
Wherever we go together, my handbag is your waist 
Yo ma honey, every time I see you, I get breathless like the streets of Myeong-dong 
Our BGM is the sound of breathing 
In your voice when you call my name, 
I’d like to get submerged and swim, I’d like to know you more 
I’m an adventurer who explores in depth a mysterious forest that is you 
I admire a masterpiece that is you  
because your existence is an art 
Like this, I imagine through the night every night 
because these are meaningless dreams to me anyway 
Just for one day, if you and I could be together 
Just for one day, if you and I could hold hands 
Just for one day, if you and I could be together 
Just one day (just one day) 
If you and I could be together 
(Do It Do It Do It) 
I wish, wish that I can be with you for just one day 
(Do It Do It Do It) 
A party, a party for just the two of us 
(Do It Do It Do It) 
I wish, wish that I can be with you for just one day 
(Do It Do It Do It) 
A party, a party for just the two of us 
If I could do that, how happy would I be 
If we could just go anywhere, eat, and watch a movie together, 
I would do anything to make it happen, girl 
I’m sorry, maybe my brain is being too rational 
But, when you see me someday, please smile at me 
A bit, or maybe a lot, you’ll resent me 
I know, since I wasn’t able to look at you anymore because of my dream 
Then please give me just one day, even in my dream, just one day 
All those words that I had to swallow, blaming the reality 
So that I can say even just one word right among those 
Yeah, let’s meet when morning glories bloom and part when they wither 
I didn’t think it would be easily forgotten, 
but, if I want you to forget me easily, would it be that I’m selfish 
I’m still lying, saying that it’s for you 
You’re standing in the center of my heart 
Just for one day, if you and I could be together 
Just for one day, if you and I could hold hands 
Just for one day, if you and I could be together 
Just one day (just one day), 
If you and I were together 
Let’s go time 
24 hours, if there is only the two of us, 
I’ll kiss you from the morning 
and we’ll have a bite of brunch that can’t be missed 
Holding hands with you, I’ll lay myself under the sun with you 
I won’t let it end, at a beautiful night,

I would like to sleep like a baby, drunk in your sweet scent 
Out of my packed schedule, if there is an opportunity, 
I would like to lay myself in your warm, deep eyes 
, when you tie up your long, long straight hair, 
your breathtaking neck and strands of hair flowing down 
Wherever we go together, my handbag is your waist 
, every time I see you, I get breathless like the streets of Myeong-dong 
Our  is the sound of breathing 
In your voice when you call my name, 
I’d like to get submerged and swim, I’d like to know you more 
I’m an adventurer who explores in depth a mysterious forest that is you 
I admire a masterpiece that is you

because these are meaningless dreams to me anyway

If I could do that, how happy would I be 
If we could just go anywhere, eat, and watch a movie together, 
I would do anything to make it happen,  
, maybe my brain is being too rational 
But, when you see me someday, please smile at me 
A bit, or maybe a lot, you’ll resent me 
I know, since I wasn’t able to look at you anymore because of my dream 
Then please give me just one day, even in my dream, just one day 
All those words that I had to swallow, blaming the reality 
So that I can say even just one word right among those 
Yeah, let’s meet when morning glories bloom and part when they wither 
I didn’t think it would be easily forgotten, 
but, if I want you to forget me easily, would it be that I’m selfish 
I’m still lying, saying that it’s for you 
You’re standing in the center of my heart 
Just for one day, if you and I could be together 
Just for one day, if you and I could hold hands 
Just for one day, if you and I could be together 
Just one day (just one day), 
If you and I were together 
Let’s go time 
24 hours, if there is only the two of us, 
I’ll kiss you from the morning 
and we’ll have a bite of brunch that can’t be missed

Tomorrow,Skool Luv Affair,2/12/2014,"Same day, same month 
24/7 every moment that repeats every time 
An ambiguous life of mine 
A jobless twenty-something is afraid of tomorrow 
Funny, right? When young, I used to believe that anything is possible 
Realizing that it’s hard even to live from hand to mouth, 
my mood is like Control beat, it keeps getting down
 
Every day repeats itself like Ctrl C, Ctrl V 
Why am I remaining in the same place when there’s a long way to go 
Even if I scream out of frustration, it only gets echoed in the empty sky 
That tomorrow will be somewhat different from today, 
I can only beg 
Follow your dream like breaker 
Even if you crash oh better 
Follow your dream like breaker 
Even if you collapse oh don’t run back never 
Because the dawn right before the sunrise is the darkest, 
you, in the future, never forget yourself of now 
Wherever you’re standing right now, you’re just taking a short break 
Don’t give up, you know it 
Don’t get too far away tomorrow 
Don’t get far away tomorrow 
Don’t get too far away tomorrow 
Tomorrow that we’ve waited for so badly soon becomes the name of yesterday as we open our eyes 
Tomorrow becomes today, today becomes yesterday, and tomorrow becomes yesterday and stands behind my back 
Life is not something you live along but something you live through, something you live through and gets disappeared someday 
If you keep spacing out, you’ll be swept away  
if you ain’t no got the guts, trust 
It’ll all end up becoming yesterday What would each day mean anyway 
I wanted to be happy, I wanted to be perseverant, but why do I keep becoming weaker 
Where am I going- I try going here, going there, and find myself keep coming to here 
Yeah, I’ll flow along to somewhere  
Would there ever be an end to this maze

Don’t get too far away tomorrow","There was a diss battle called “control diss battle” in Korean hip hop scene in the summer of 2013. Rappers involved in this battle used the beat from ‘Control,’ a song by Big Sean, featuring Kendrick Lamar and Jay Electronica (side info: ‘Control’ itself called out rappers by name and was responded with many diss tracks). Many well-known and rookie rappers participated in this battle (link to a Soompi article with timeline), and ‘I downloaded the Control beat’ became a popular slang meaning ‘to recriminate.’ In Konglish (Korean-style English), ‘download’ is often shortened to ‘down,’ which completes the wordplay here: “I keep feeling down like Control beat gets downed.”","Same day, same month

BTS Cypher PT. 2 : Triptych,Skool Luv Affair,2/12/2014,"Because of who? Because of j-hope 
Because of who? Because of Rap Mon 
Again, because of who? Because of SUGA 
All the style and trend are because of Bangtan 
A play that has begun again, of the kids who’ll lead the 21 century Hallyu  
We’re seven wolves, herding the sheep that are the alause 
We tow away the broken raps we see from now 
We keep advancing, a giant on the beat
 
Bangtan cypher right here, psycho right here 
No matter who’s in the ring, we win, rap fighter right here 
I’m “hi“, you’re “bye,” burning tires, we run 
Fire, hot choir, like Psy we’ll dominate the pop music 
My rap, a giant, fucks your ears up right in your face
 
Our attack that became more violent than ever 
With no need for a long speech, I explain with rap 
BTS, follow the leader, go from now on
 
What 
I’m rap wiper, a total psycho 
If I were a dicer, hey, I would have all the dice 
Cypher 
If you’re nice, hey, I’m nicer 
If you’re Pride, hey, I’m Chrysler 
that mean imma priceless 
What are you to grade my rap with your knowledge, rapper? 
This place is One Piece, I’m Whitebeard
 
You guys are just long beards, catfish in one word 
Fuck it 
Heeheehaha beep beep, I go at the speed of 300km/hr 
I followed the steps of becoming greater 
No matter who they are, I get them all, Tombstone 
knock knock knock out 
Fire in the hole, bitch 
BING BING POW POW 
You cry and look for your dad 
My voice that ever-strangles the necks of rap minors, PC Bang closes 
This is a kingdom, I’m a king, you’re dumb
 
I chew and swallow, you’re bubble gum
 
Above a running man is a flying man, then a man who’s riding the flying man 
That’s me, bitch, a guy even worse than rain 
I just hang you up like a rag, I play you and 
rip apart your eardrums at once, boom boom boom 
This is my curse of dawn 
Nightmares, assaults, serial murders, robberies, doom doom doom 
You’re a KakaoTalk with no friend, I don’t have anything to do with you 
Did you already pee your pants? Sorry, there’s no bathroom 
I command now, put the mic down and stand up 
You’re just lowly because you’re a silly nonsense 
I push you away because I hate you so much 
I’m pretty good at sewing, I put my words into action 
I growl now, you’re in a bit of danger 
You just do a kite, I told you, there’s no thread 
You go up into the sky, go up and get torn apart 
Fuck it, Joosuc, I forgot you 
My voice, my hegemony 
I’ve raised them all from one to ten 
I put the entire world on my tongue 
I play in the big water, I ain’t spittin low sh 
On the CD or TV, 
you can see me, envy me, it’s a pity, gee gee 
Bitch I’mma monster I rap with a prospect, 
yeah I rap with a mindset I’m a suspect 
Sucka where yo rhymes at where you lines at? 
I’m da king, I’m the god so where ma emperors at? 
I parachute on my Neverland, 
I’mma peter pan, so this will never end 
You know when I ride on my G5 you sit first class and satisfy and I keep giggling 
Keep gigglin, keep jigglin, 
Bring yo booking mic, bitch, do you want to fight? 
Blindly possessed hyungs full of pride and weird conviction, they get astonished by my 8 bars 
Old caterpillers, d- d- d- dirty 
Let me give you this beat, give it a try you p- p- pests 
Talk when you can actually rap 
You should be forbidden from rapping, by law 
Because of whom? Because of j-hope 
Because of whom? Because of Rap Mon 
Again, because of whom? Because of SUGA 
Three of us, gathered, shout the new generation 
Because of whom? Because of j-hope 
Because of whom? Because of Rap Mon 
Again, because of whom? Because of SUGA 
On this beat, the next hitter raps 
My domain is dopeman.com 
I scolded many with my mic 
Your speech and actions are like shackles 
The name of my charge is “assault with tongue” 
Full of piety, you’re born-believer since birth 
If you’re going to be a crybaby on this beat, just go home early 
Look at those stubborn, preachy hip hop oldies with their stiff necks 
When you play underground, BTS plays above ground 
Compared to you who slept through all night, 
i’m workerholic shopperholic 
I overconsumed pens, more than your fans, and went all in 
When I kick the ball, goal in 
goal in i’m ballin 
I puke when I listen to your rap 
My voice, which bewitches even your girlfriend, gets them horny 
The studio is my playground, and my partners are pen and paper 
You, thinking my courtesy is your right, should quickly put your mic down 
If I’m the sun, you’re the moon 
because when I rise, you fall 
You bastards judging the value of hip hop, 
step down from the bubbles 
Hey you mischievous boys  
Your mischievous raps are just whining about your lives
 개구진 (gaegujin; mischievous) can be a satoori-variation of 개구린 (gaegurin), which is a combination of 개 (gae; dog or a prefix meaning “very”) and 구린 (gurin; bad in quality or stinky). 
The time you’ve waited for, go take some rest 
“You go, to Hawaii,” go home
 
Watch how far I go 
I plow the rotten roots out completely  
A big upset when no one expected a decisive win 
When you just whine without trying and play while making excuses that you’re doing music, 
look for more part-time jobs
 
It’s probably not worth trying with your short and thin career, 
but make sure you survive and continue to rot 
Your nametags probably will be “a life like an amateur” 
Your raps are Anabada 
You, who uses someone else’s the flow that was used frugally and shared and yet again reuses it 
Hey bitches, you should know your shame 
My 24 bars make you lie down sick 
Compared to your frame, your rap is fragile 
As if I’m your parent, my heart aches whenever I see you 
I draw the period onto the artery of your music careeri-yeo","Reference: Attack on Bangtan

Whitebeard, a character in One Piece, is the captain of the Whitebeard Pirates and the strongest man in the world. 
(1) Rhyme: 흰 수염 (heuin sooyeom; white beard) – 긴 수염 (gin sooyeom; long beard) 
(2) Metaphor: 메기 (megi; catfish), known for its flattened head prominent barbels that resemble a cat’s whiskers, is often used as a metaphor for an ugly person. 
(3) Wordplay: 한 마디로 메기여 (han madiro megiyeo) means “it’s catfish, to put it in one word.” But it also sounds similar to “한 마디로 멕여 (han madiro megyeo)” where 멕여 is a misspell (slang) of 먹여, which in the context means to strike a blow, to trick someone, or to screw someone over. So it also can be “I’m Whitebeard, you guys are just long beards. I screw you over with one word.” 
Wordplay: 절차탁마 (jeolchatakma; 切磋琢磨), which literally means to polish precious stones by chiseling, filing, and shining them, means to diligently and thoroughly cultivate one’s learning or virtuous conduct. 절차 (jeolcha; 節次), although it’s pronounced the same as the first two letters of 절차탁마, means a procedure/order/step of something.

“뛰는 놈 위에 나는 놈 있다 (above a running man is a flying man)” is an idiom that means there’s someone who’s better than you no matter how good you are. RM describes himself as the one riding the flying one, meaning his even better than the better one.

Wordplay: “널기만 해” means “I only hang it up.” But changing the placement of space, “널 기만해,” would mean “I deceive you.” 걸레, a rag, often has a negative connotation since it’s supposed to be dirty and is also a slang for slut.

Wordplay:
(1) 볼 일 없어 means “I don’t have any occasion to see something/someone” where 일 is an event or an occasion.
(2) But 일 can also be 1. KakaoTalk is a messenger app widely used in Korea. You have a “1” notification when you have an incoming message or there is one person in the chat who did not read a message; “You’re a KakaoTalk with no friend. You have no 1 to see.”

A common example would be 모태신자, which means a born-believer. But what this line is meant to mean is, really,  
“from when you were born, you can’t do anything.” 
Wordplay/censoring: 조퇴해 (jotoehae) is “go home early (from school/work),” but, he actually raps 좆돼 (jottoe; literally means “become a dick”), which means “get fucked up.”

As explained in Paldogangsan, 아나바다 is a campaign whose name is a short form of 아껴쓰고 나눠쓰고 바꿔쓰고 다시쓰자 (Be frugal, share, exchange, and reuse). The campaign dates back to 1998, a year after the financial crisis of 1997.  
Here he explains 아나바다: 아껴 쓰고 (used frugally), 나눠 쓴 (used by sharing), 받아쓰고 (pronounced 바다쓰고; used something received from someone else), and 다시 쓰는 (using again).","Because of who? Because of j-hope

I just hang you up like a rag, I play you and 
rip apart your eardrums at once,  
This is my curse of dawn 
Nightmares, assaults, serial murders, robberies,  
You’re a KakaoTalk with no friend, I don’t have anything to do with you 
Did you already pee your pants? Sorry, there’s no bathroom 
I command now, put the  down and stand up 
You’re just lowly because you’re a silly nonsense 
I push you away because I hate you so much 
I’m pretty good at sewing, I put my words into action 
I growl now, you’re in a bit of danger 
You just do a kite, I told you, there’s no thread 
You go up into the sky, go up and get torn apart 
Fuck it, Joosuc, I forgot you 
My voice, my hegemony 
I’ve raised them all from one to ten 
I put the entire world on my tongue 
I play in the big water, 
or  
you can see me, envy me, it’s a pity, gee gee 
Bitch I’mma monster I rap with a prospect, 
yeah I rap with a mindset I’m a suspect 
Sucka where yo rhymes at where you lines at? 
I’m da king, I’m the god so where ma emperors at? 
I parachute on my Neverland, 
I’mma peter pan, so this will never end 
You know when I ride on my G5 you sit first class and satisfy and I keep giggling 
Keep gigglin, keep jigglin, 
, do you want to fight? 
Blindly possessed hyungs full of pride and weird conviction, they get astonished by my 8 bars 
Old caterpillers, d- d- d- dirty 
Let me give you this beat, give it a try you p- p- pests 
Talk when you can actually rap 
You should be forbidden from rapping, by law 
Because of whom? Because of j-hope 
Because of whom? Because of Rap Mon 
Again, because of whom? Because of SUGA 
Three of us, gathered, shout the new generation 
Because of whom? Because of j-hope 
Because of whom? Because of Rap Mon 
Again, because of whom? Because of SUGA 
On this , the next hitter raps 
My domain is  
I scolded many with my mic 
Your speech and actions are like shackles 
The name of my charge is “assault with tongue” 
Full of piety, you’re born-believer since birth 
If you’re going to be a crybaby on this beat, just go home early 
Look at those stubborn, preachy hip hop oldies with their stiff necks 
When you play underground plays above ground 
Compared to you who slept through all night, 
i’m workerholic shopperholic 
I overconsumed s, more than your s, and went 
When I kick the ball,  
goal in i’m ballin 
I puke when I listen to your rap 
My voice, which bewitches even your girlfriend, gets them horny 
The studio is my playground, and my partners are pen and paper 
You, thinking my courtesy is your right, should quickly put your mic down 
If I’m the sun, you’re the moon 
because when I rise, you fall 
You bastards judging the value of hip hop, 
step down from the bubbles 
Hey you mischievous boys  
Your mischievous raps are just whining about your lives
Wordplay: 개구진 (; mischievous) can be a satoori-variation of 개구린 (), which is a combination of 개 (gae; dog or a prefix meaning “very”) and 구린 (gurin; bad in quality or stinky). 
The time you’ve waited for, go take some rest 
“You go, to Hawaii,” go home
 
Watch how far I go 
I plow the rotten roots out completely  
A big upset when no one expected a decisive win 
When you just whine without trying and play while making excuses that you’re doing music, 
look for more part-time jobs
 
It’s probably not worth trying with your short and thin career, 
but make sure you survive and continue to rot 
Your nametags probably will be “a life like an amateur” 
Your raps are Anabada 
You, who uses someone else’s the  that was used frugally and shared and yet again reuses it 
Hey bitches, you should know your shame 
My 24 bars make you lie down sick 
Compared to your frame, your rap is fragile 
As if I’m your parent, my heart aches whenever I see you 
I draw the period onto the artery of your music career","right here

You whined and tried so hard to have it given to you, did I hit a nerve? 
Just like the fully filled padding, your greed continues to get filled up 
Even after seeing your parents’ backs bending, you’re heartlessly relentless 
You’re whining that all your friends have them, making it hard for your parents to not buy one for you 
(Ayo baby) Don’t behave so childishly 
You won’t freeze to death even if you don’t wear that padded jacket

filling your brain with some common sense before it gets too late

A damn spine breaker","송창식 – 왜 불러 (Song Chang-sik – Why do you call me; 1975)
Extra note: it’s a little funny when you listen to the actual CD (or listen to the album in order) because Cypher PT. 2 ends with SUGA’s “Hey!!!” and this track begins with “Why do you call me.” 
(a) Education goes to the mountains: 산으로 가다 (going to the mountains), as explained in  
, is often used to describe someone’s digressing from the topic/goal. The line should read “Education is digressing from its purpose”
(b) Students go to the mountains: 산으로 가다 (going to the mountains) is more literal here since The North Face is an outdoor clothing brand.  
벗는 자 is one who undresses, as opposed to 벗은 자, one who is (already) undressed. Another problem associated with this padded jacket fever was extortion bullyings; bullies would threaten weaker students in expensive jackets and take the jackets from them, having them undress. 
(RM’s verse: he takes a different stance.) 
배부르다 (be full) is also used when someone who has everything needed/wanted and nothing else to wish for complains about their current situation. The expression comes up again in J-Hope’s verse. 
South Korean population was about 50 million when the track was released. 
Literally translated, the above line is “but your current status is where you’re too full.” As explained in RM’s verse, “you” are complaining even though you have everything you need/want.","Why do you call me

The year 2007 when my life changed 
It’s already been 7 years since I started singing like that 
A killer of girls’ hearts 
But, sometimes I go back to that frustrating time 
and face myself who was like an empty white paper 
That encounter wakes up another me 
Now, I go onto the stage in a cool way 
and, so that everyone gets surprised, jump like Jordan 
Ball! 
I go back just as who I am now, 
take out a trampoline that had been stuck in the corner of the room for years, 
and jump around on an open field 
With one jump, I feel the joy 
With you who looked like was going to have everything 
and with the innocent dreams, I embroider myself 
In my childhood days when I hoped to become an adult, 
every day was filled with joy

Being made by seven hero-wannabes who used to be only naive is the jump sound

I only think of you, always 
I’ll become a rhythm, I’ll become a song, 
and I’ll sing myself for you 
(Good to you) 
You’re the only one for me 
(Good to you) 
Even if I’m far away, 
please stay by my side 
(Good to you) 
You’re everything for me 
Even if a harsh day arrives tomorrow 
Please hold my hand 
I give it to you 
It was a bit awkward, 
but now I want to give it all to you 
I give it to you 
Sometimes crying and sometimes laughing for me, 
you’re the only one for me 
For you

it’s a 
 miss, right? Miss Right? (All Right) 
You’re my Miss Right, Miss Right  
Girl you want my kiss, right? Miss Right (All Right) 
Your sexy mind and your sexy body 
A woman born with even the brain wrinkles being sexy, every single one of them 
Yeah, denim shorts, white t-shirt, and converse high 
That makes me wanna party on your body 
At the ends of your silky smooth hair, 
your refreshing hip is singing
 
A forest-like you shine inside the city, 
embracing my reality with your unrealistic body 
And I want you to be really really real for me 
Sometimes like my mother, sometimes as my energy 
Oh I’m being honest 
My enemy who’s so nice on the outside as well that I can’t relax for a moment 
It must be because you’re different from normal types out there 
that a woman like you are called the ideal type
 
Yeah, when I think of you, my heart keeps aching 
Yeah 
My winter sea, I want to walk on you 
Yes you’re my only girl you’re the best to me 
I want to know your day, I want to be your sigh 
Yes you’re my only girl you’re the best to me 
That person who I thought would only exist in movies 
Even the weather is perfect, it feels like I’m perfect with you 
Shall we walk together shall we walk together 
Even the weather is perfect, it feels like you’re perfect with me 
That person who I thought would exist only exist in novels 
is you 
How can a person be like that? 
I feel like you’re living in the world all by yourself
 
You who’s passing by me 
A sweet wind called you blows in my mind 
Though you don’t really fancy yourself up, 
perhaps you’ll put on a perfume called charm 
Even I who used to believe that there’s no god was made to believe in god 
To me, the goddess is you 
Whether or not you’re young, old, or have a hidden child, 
I don’t care because I love you 
As long as I’m with you, everywhere is a garden with flowers in bloom 
Rather than holding a designer bag, you hold my hand, 
and rather than getting jealous and envious, you understand my inner character, 
I picture our future with you who’s like that 
A pair of kids’ sneakers between our matching shoes 
Yes you’re my only girl you’re the best to me 
I want to know your day, I want to be your sigh 
Yes you’re my only girl you’re the best to me 
That person who I thought would only exist in movies 
If feels like the heroine who shook my heart came right in front of me 
It feels like I’m attracted like a magnet, right now, to you 
Your life, your heart, your face, and your line 
You’re like a completed puzzle of my ideal type  
Oh god, a wind that is led by the weather called you 
You’re a flower, and I’m a bee, only going towards you all the time

Most “good” colleges are geographically concentrated in Seoul (though there are few exceptionally well-known private institutions elsewhere in the country).  Whether students can get into in-Seoul universities or not is a major criterion when evaluating their academic performances, and even further, when predicting their future career path/success. SKY is an abbreviation (made of the first letters) of Seoul National University, Korea University, and Yonsei University, which are considered the top three universities in Korea.

Music, turn it up 
I’d pick my nose out of boredom 
I’d make a song and make everyone on earth sing it

Yeah, and next, my driver’s license that’s not being used, 
I should wake it up from sleep 
I’d buy a four-wheel drive car and fill her up 
Even if this kind of thing is too much, I’d pay in interest-free installments 
Investing in stocks and gambling, I don’t want to do such things 
Don’t ask me why my dream is so small when I’m ruling the world 
I, with Bangtan family, 
am still, nonetheless, hungry for music 
I’d become the Kim Jong-Un of the hip hop scene

I wondered what kind of taste it was when we were dating,

which makes a bit of sense now that you’re not here girl

I’d choose to play with fire again though I will later regret  
Our promises that made us hurt, 
countless faults, and the rights and wrongs that can’t be talked about, placed in between those faults

and how we chose to part, promising to meet one day in the far future 
The minty aroma that we used to like together–

It’s been a while, but why is it that I miss you sometimes these days?

BTS Cypher Part 1,"O!RUL8,2?",9/11/2013,"Damn, hip hop pride 
Idol rapper? Cut that ember 
Saying my essence is a shitty idol, you look down on me 
You give away your principles and spinelessly laugh at my name 
You, who only know about watering things down and belittling others, 
how you kill me? 
So i bring the monster back, my monster swag 
So this is the monster track cuz of my freaking monster rap 
The Hong Gildongs of the modern era, you see a good thing and can’t even say you like it
 
The third generation leader, so imma lead ya, this is a transition of generations
 
I’m sayin yeah im the top of the top of the top 
poppin’em, rockin’em, stoppin’em, blockin’em, like the Cassius’ lance 
Imma don, don’t turn off the beat, becuz im not freakin done 
Don’t play around on the beat cuz every kick is my freaking zone  
I’m usually generous but imma murder your rappers 
I’m going to cut you one by one then imma murder you haters 
Now look at me and tell me, who are your top 5? 
Rap Monster, Randa, leader, RapMon, your daddy 
It’s hope world, from BTS 
Everyone follows me, and my possibility gets retweeted 
I announce my flow to everyone, 
It fills your body, flowing through the eardrums 
I sharpened my knife for tomorrow,  
get back in the days 
I wasn’t so young, I was a kid who didn’t even know what a rhyme is 
I, who was just one of those kids in Gwangju who wanted to become an idol 
Yeah, let me show you know  
In the cypher on this track, I reveal my ambition 
i’m above the minors 
Yeah, a major unlike you, uh  
I fill the TV screen, uh 
Rapper costume?  
No, I spit out, after cleaning the bubble away, what I’ve wanted 
Wherever I go now, it’s an issue 
If your stomach hurts, go to the hospital, it’ll take two weeks to recover 
Everyone who hoped for my defeat holds the back of their neck 
In this game where hip hop pride overflows, j-hope is a foul
 
I haven’t served my military duty,  but my hobby is sniping 
I gave them a punch with We Are Bulletproof 
Clumsy dummies respond, feeling guilty 
Keep having your inferior complex explode 
The resolution of my pronunciation is 4K, I’m dope man 
I’m a Chopin on the beat 
I never change, From when I was born, I was a born rapper 
My attitude is my mentor 
Even if you chew and bite me off, I’m a memento 
Show me your hip hop pride, the feeling of powerlessness you have, seeing me 
Hide your jealousy, your IP might show 
I’m a boiler, I became hot instantly  
Like a spoiler, you became predictable without  
I fixed the helplessly stupid hip hop losers 
In this pop scene that has grown in size without fundamentals, it’s tough to coexist 
So just rap as a hobby 
The world is going to the dogs 
If you feel guilty, try harder, what","불씨 is literally the seed (씨) of fire (불), which is used to describe something that can spark up something bigger. The pronunciation of 불씨, bulssi, is similar to bullshit, which justifies the placement of 불씨 (“cut that BS”). 
홍길동 (Hong Gildong) is the main character of The Story of Hong Gildong. Born as a child of a concubine, he could not call his father father and his hyung (legitimate son of his father) hyung. 
BTS belongs to the 3rd generation of Korean idols. 
“One’s stomach hurts” is synonymous to “one is jealous” 
Holding the back of one’s neck when someone gets extremely angry or surprised by something completely unexpected is a cliche in Korean dramas. 
(Foul as a cheat code in games) 
Wordplay: 못 해 (can’t do; mot-hae) is pronounced 모태 (mo-tae). “I never change. From when I was born, I can’t do it. Born rapper.” 모태 (母胎; mo-tae), literally meaning ‘inside mother’s womb,’ is used when someone is a born-something. “I never change. From when I was born, I’m a born rapper.”",", hip hop pride

Advance","The above two lines are based on an online meme that started circulating back in 2005. There was a scene from a comic book series, Starcraft, where there are three characters talking with each other. One says “but what will happen if a Dragoon moves?” and the other two characters each says “Deu!” and “Ra!” and the first one completes the word by shouting “Goon!” It became a meme and there were many who randomly write “but what will happen if a Dragoon moves?” in a group chat or comment section. Others will then take turns to say “Deu!”, “Ra!”, and “Goon!”  
Rhyme: 괴물 (gwoemul; monster) & 퇴물 (twoemul; has-been) 
Wordplay: (1) 굿 is a Korean traditional shaman ritual or exorcism, liked to the previous line where the lyrics are so good as if they’re possessed. “I always do the shaman ritual to get rid of the soul that possesses my lyrics.” (2) 굿 is pronounced gut and is what good is spelled in Korean. So the line can also be “I’m always good.”

Reference: one of Kang Baekho’s famous lines, “the left hand is simply assisting.”

My two feet boastfully blow the horn 
I throw my hat into the ring, advancing to the pop scene 
Look at my first bat, I hit a home run 
If you’re not confident, put down your bat 
I do my stage however I feel like 
I shoot (a basketball) however I want 
But the public’s cheers still fill my ears 
Yeah, I’m Kang Baekho on the stage
 
I’ve proved it all, the mic is simply assisting

Our reaching the top is a matter of time 
The dominos where the first block has been pushed down 
Yeah, push them down 
When they open their eyes, we will captivate their ears on the stage 
My rap banquet that is sensuous like this 
Once you taste it, you run out of breath 
And you get completely desperate

 Here’s Jin using it to Jungkook. 
거시기 (geosigi), as explained in Where You From, is a magical word that can be anything and everything. It can be a noun, pronoun, adjective, adverb, verb, or, really, anything. There is no equivalent word in standard Korean. Here it can be “hey” or “there.” 
물 (mul), which means water, can refer to the (condition of) crowd or the atmosphere at a pub or a club when used as a slang. Based on his dance moves and the next line, it can be “how would I rap when the crowd is not enjoying it fully”  
, which should be familiar to many fans thanks to  
, was an elite warrior group of young males in  
, an ancient kingdom of the Korean Peninsula (57 BC – 935 AD). Gyeongju of Gyeongsang province was its capital. 
Jeolla province is famous for its food with Bibimbap being one of its signature dishes (Jeonju).  
가가 가가 (gaga gaga) is a fun example of Gyeongsang dialect. Let’s say we’re having a conversation. The first 가 is “that guy,” referring to the guy that we just started talking about. The second 가 is a postposition to the first 가. The third 가, which also means “that guy,” refers to the guy that we have been talking about. The last 가 is a Gyeonsang satoori version of 니, an ending for interrogative sentences.  
Gyeongsang dialect (especially words and intonations used by men) tends to be strong and harsh, and men from Gyeongsang province also has a stereotypical image of manly, almost macho-like men. 
(1) 정 (jeong) is hard to be translated into or be explained in other languages (it’s actually pretty hard to define 정 even in Korean). 정 is a very broad concept of love that includes affection, emotional attachment, sympathy, and compassion. The feeling can be toward humans, animals, and even objects. It also doesn’t have to be absolutely positive. (Yup, I just copy-pasted my notes from Moving On.)
(2) 아나바다, which I translated as “the spirit of sharing everything,” is actually a campaign name that is a short form of 아껴쓰고 나눠쓰고 바꿔쓰고 다시쓰자 (Be frugal, share, exchange, and reuse). The campaign dates back to 1998, a year after the financial crisis of 1997. 
아주라 (ahjura) is something you’d hear in a baseball stadium in Gyeongsan region. When someone catches a foul ball, people will shout “아주라,” which means “give it to a kid.” 
The exact expression used is “is your mouth blocked?”  
홍어회 (hongeo hoe; raw stingray) is a fermented raw fish dish, another signature dish of Jeolla province. It is notorious for its extremely sharp, pungent aroma and often gets described as the extremest Korean food. The nose is the smelliest part, and Heuksando (in south Jeolla) is the most well-known place for fermented stingray. The smell is so strong and sharp that you can feel it with your nose and eyes almost immediately after putting a piece into your mouth. 
“Since your mouth is blocked, have a bite of fermented stingray to open it up.” 
From here, J-Hope describes BTS as his baby and as a watermelon — Mudeung mountain watermelon, specifically — and praise BTS. Mudeung mountain watermelon is the largest, most expensive watermelon in Korea. Farmers usually start harvesting mudeung mountain watermelons in mid-August. 
Pregnant with a big mudeung mountain watermelon (=BTS). 
20kg is about 44 lbs. 
[Dialogue between SUGA and j-hope] 
Side note: Seoul (and the surrounding regions) definitely has its own dialect (called Seoul dialect or Gyeonggi dialect) although Seoul language is supposed to be the standard Korean. 
Munsan is close to the  
,  
, and the  
. There’s also an operating train station that is closest to the border with North Korea. Marado is a small island in southernmost South Korea. I’ve marked Munsan and Marado on the map.","Yo once again

Okay, mom- I’m on my way to the library now
 
What is the you that you’ve dreamed of 
Who do you see in the mirror now, I gotta say 
Go on your own way 
Even if you live only one day, 
do something 
Put your weakness away 
Why aren’t you saying anything? You said studying isn’t your thing 
You’re actually scared to drop out of school, right?  
Look- you’re already preparing to go to school 
Please grow up, dude you’re just all talk with a glass mentality
 
(Stop!) Ask yourself if you have ever tried hard 
Hey you, what is your dream 
Hey you, what is your dream 
Hey you, what is your dream 
Is your dream only that? 
It’s a lie you such a liar 
See me see me ya you’re a hypocrite 
Why do you keep telling me to go on a different path,  
Hey take care of your own business 
Please don’t force me 
(La la la la la) What is your dream What is your dream What is it 
(La la la la la) It is only this Is it only this Is it 
On a same boring day, on every repetitive day, 
adults and parents forcefully instill dreams that are molded  
No. 1 dream job… a government employee?
 
It’s not a forced dream– a relief pitcher in the bottom of the ninth
 
Throw a fast ball to the self-study time that is a waste of time
 
Rebel against this hell-like society, give your dream a special pardon
 
Ask yourself what the profile of your dream is 
Be the subject of your own life that has been only suppressed
 
What is the you that you’ve dreamed of 
Who do you see in the mirror now, I gotta say 
Go on your own way 
Even if you live only one day, 
do something 
Put your weakness away

(La la la la la) It is only this Is it only this Is it 
You don’t know how to live through 
You don’t know how to fly away 
You don’t know how to decide 
You now don’t even know how to dream 
Open, open, open your eyes
 
Now dance, dance, dance 
Then dream, dream, dream again 
Don’t hesitate, don’t be indecisive, wussup!

To all the youngsters without dreams","Most ‘good’ colleges are geographically concentrated in Seoul (though there are few exceptionally well-known private institutions elsewhere in the country). In fact “in-Seoul” is a term commonly used to describe universities in Seoul. Whether students can get into in-Seoul universities or not is a major criterion when evaluating their academic performances, and even further, when predicting their future career path/success. “I’ll go somewhere even if it’s far away” means that he will go to any college not necessarily in Seoul because “getting the diploma” is what matters more than what he learns. 
독서실 is actually very different from a library, but I can’t think of a non-Korean equivalent of 독서실. It’s a (mostly) private facility where people (mostly high school students and those who are preparing for exams) go to study. Though the layout/style varies across different 독서실, it looks like this. Basically you pay a monthly fee and get a desk with a small cabinet. It’s extremely quiet, and everyone studies for whatever exam they are preparing for. (The one I went to in my senior year of high school opened at 9AM and closed at 2AM, 7 days a week. It’s pretty intense.) 
유리 멘탈, which literally is translated into a glass mentality, is slang for a very weak mentality that’s easily discouraged  
[janglaehuimang neombeowon… gongmuwon?]
 
As the economy slows down and the youth unemployment rate keeps remaining very high in Korea, a lot of students now wish to become government employees for the sake of job security. A majority of students actually state that they’d want to become government employees in surveys. 
[guwontusu]
 
(1) Suga raps until 구원 (relief; pronounced guwon), which rhymes with 넘버원 (neombeowon) and 공무원 (gongmuwon), and J-Hope completes the word by starting his part with 투수 (pitcher). This seems to be a strategic part division to highlight the rhymes.
 
(2) For those who are not familiar with baseball rules: “a relief pitcher in the bottom of the ninth” basically happens when the away team is tightly leading the game or the game is tied in the final inning. A relief pitcher of the away team then has to keep the lead. 
(1) 야자 is an abbreviation of 야간자율학습시간 (night self-study time). A lot of Korean high schools have 야자, which requires high school students to stay at school and study on their own unless they have valid excuses. The regular class time is from 8-9AM to 5PM-ish, and then students have 야자 until 9-10PM after dinner. (And yes, some students will go to 독서실 after 야자, especially if they are in their senior year.)
 
(2) 돌직구 is a combination of 돌 (stone) and 직구 (fast ball), referring to a very strong fast ball. It is also a slang meaning a straightforward and blunt comment. 
I remember that when I listened to the song for the very first time (before I read the lyrics), I thought he said dick (좆; pronounced jot) instead of hell (지옥; pronounced jiok) and wondered how it didn’t get censored. 좆같은 (dick-like) is a curse word similar to “fucking,” so I’d say it’s very likely that the pronunciation was intentional. 
“Be the subject as opposed to the object” 
“Open your eyes, eyes, eyes” are the original Korean lyrics.","Hey you, what is your dream

To the present with no room for change, I closed my eyes

저 달 (Moonlight),D-2,5/22/2020,"Yeah, yeah 
Okay, okay, okay, okay 
Yeah 
Three years have passed 
Agust D 
Honestly, I don’t know how many songs to put in, 
Fuck, I’m just doing it 
The beginning was small, Daegu, yeah, from a basement in Namsandong
 
to a penthouse in Hannam the Hill now, ha  
A Peter Pan who still can’t wake up from his dream 
In my head, the reality fights with the ideal tirelessly 
My biggest enemy is the anger inside me 
The more dreadful is the battle with the laziness inside me 
Sometimes I resent god, asking why he made me live a life like this, 
what I’m doing, and if I love music at all 
Sometimes I ask myself again, ‘if it’s possible to go back, 
will you go back?’ Well, I’ll have to think more about that 
One moment I feel like I’ve easily earned what I have, 
and the next moment I’m compensated for the fucking hard works I’ve done 
But I’m still hungry, would this be karma? 
The emptiness that I feel after flying fucking high 
Although it’s been more than 10 years since I started in Namsandong, 
it’s the same that my head is a mess, fuck that 
That moonlight that shines on me at dawn 
It’s still the same as then 
A lot changed in my life, but 
that moonlight is still the same 
That moonlight that shines on me at dawn 
It’s still the same as then 
Changes are fated to happen to everyone 
Perhaps, how we change is what our undertaking is about 
Sometimes I feel like I’m a genius 
Sometimes I feel like I have no talent 
Sometimes songs write themselves like crazy, but then, 
when I’m stuck, I’m stuck like there’s no way out, yeah, right now 
I wrote Verse1 fucking fast, 
but can’t make Verse2 no matter how hard I rack my brain 
It probably would be the same for life, all or nothing 
There’s no parallel anyway, it’s a matter of choice 
There would be no eternity for anything  
Being called immortal is fucking overwhelming 
I started just because I liked music, 
but the adjectives they attach to my name feel too much sometimes 
What can I do, I should just keep running 
What can I do, I should just keep hold of things that I’m grasping 
What can I do, I should just pay back what I’ve received 
If you think you’re gonna crash, accelerate even harder, you idiot 
That moonlight that shines on me at dawn 
It’s still the same as then 
A lot changed in my life, but 
that moonlight is still the same 
That moonlight that shines on me at dawn 
It’s still the same as then 
Changes are fated to happen to everyone

In my head, the reality fights with the ideal tirelessly 
My biggest enemy is the anger inside me 
The more dreadful is the battle with the laziness inside me 
Sometimes I resent god, asking why he made me live a life like this, 
what I’m doing, and if I love music at all 
Sometimes I ask myself again, ‘if it’s possible to go back, 
will you go back?’ Well, I’ll have to think more about that 
One moment I feel like I’ve easily earned what I have, 
and the next moment I’m compensated for the fucking hard works I’ve done 
But I’m still hungry, would this be karma? 
The emptiness that I feel after flying fucking high 
Although it’s been more than 10 years since I started in Namsandong, 
it’s the same that my head is a mess,  
That moonlight that shines on me at dawn 
It’s still the same as then 
A lot changed in my life, but 
that moonlight is still the same 
That moonlight that shines on me at dawn 
It’s still the same as then 
Changes are fated to happen to everyone 
Perhaps, how we change is what our undertaking is about 
Sometimes I feel like I’m a genius 
Sometimes I feel like I have no talent 
Sometimes songs write themselves like crazy, but then, 
when I’m stuck, I’m stuck like there’s no way out, yeah, right now 
I wrote  fucking fast, 
but can’t make  no matter how hard I rack my brain 
It probably would be the same for life, all or nothing 
There’s no parallel anyway, it’s a matter of choice 
There would be no eternity for anything  
Being called immortal is fucking overwhelming 
I started just because I liked music, 
but the adjectives they attach to my name feel too much sometimes 
What can I do, I should just keep running 
What can I do, I should just keep hold of things that I’m grasping 
What can I do, I should just pay back what I’ve received 
If you think you’re gonna crash, accelerate even harder, you idiot 
That moonlight that shines on me at dawn 
It’s still the same as then 
A lot changed in my life, but 
that moonlight is still the same 
That moonlight that shines on me at dawn 
It’s still the same as then 
Changes are fated to happen to everyone 
Perhaps, how we change is what our undertaking is about","Yeah, yeah

Note: Gwanghae-gun was the fifteenth king of the Joseon dynasty. He was deposed and not restored and given the temple name. The “born a slave, risen to a king” line seems to be based on the fictional plot of the 2012 movie 광해: 왕이 된 남자 (Masquerade; Wikipedia, official trailer) where the king finds a double in order to avoid the constant threat of assassination. (There’s also a 2019 drama, 왕이 된 남자 (The Crowned Clown), which is a remake of Masquerade.) 
Note: The above line references the story of 사도세자 (Crown Prince Sado), who died of starvation by being confined in a rice chest, which was by order of his father. 
Reference: ‘give it to me‘ (“ 
Born a tiger, I can’t live like a dog”)
Double entendre: 약하다 can be (1) to be weak or (2) to do drugs.

Note: The above line is something you’d hear in historical dramas when executing someone as shown in the MV. 
Note: 선비 (seonbi) are virtuous classical scholars during the Goryeo and Joseon dynasties. These days, 선비 is used as a slang to describe someone who’s always serious, ethically conservative, not fun, and inclined to make objections about other people’s opinions. 
Side note: 현타 is an abbreviation of (1) 현자타임 (a wise man time) or (2) 현실자각타임 (reality-realizing time), a slang that describes (re:1) a mental status where you have no greed or desire because you realized that the desire is meaningless or (re:2) the moment when you come back to reality after being completely absorbed in something.
Side-side note: I didn’t think it’s necessary to point it out, but am just going to put it here since many are taking the origin of this word as the (only) meaning of it. The origin of this slang (the first one: a wise man time) is related to the feelings men feel after masterbation, a sense of futility and guilt after pursuing/experiencing sexual pleasure. The word became to be used more widely with different meanings (on the internet, in everyday conversations, and even on TV). It refers to the moment when one (a) realizes the reality while exploring unrealistic ideas and hopes or (b) suddenly loses the passion for something that they have been devoting themselves to. I personally read this line as something along the line of ‘I’ve achieved everything and there’s nothing above me. Now what?,’ NOT related to the literal origin of the word (1).   
Note: This is also something you’d hear in historical dramas when torturing a suspect.","Daechwita, Daechwita, hey, play it loud, Daechwita

Wordplay: The last letter of 양극화 (兩極化), 화 (化, pronounced hwa) means ‘to become.’ The chinese letter for flower (꽃) is 화 (花), which is also pronounced hwa. This explains why they called polarization a flower. 
Note: Social media feed — Instagram, to be specific. People post ostentatiously, making sure that their feeds reflect (or, fabricate) their wealth and luxurious lives. 
Note: the dog collars and dog houses are probably those of ours, not dogs’, as we are ‘dogs’ of the system. 
Note: He’s probably refering to the Instagram logo (especailly given the ‘My feed explains me’ line above).

it feels like my heart has broken down 
  
I thought I’d change when I turned twenty 
I thought I’d change when I graduated 
, like that, that, when I become thirty, 
yeah, so what changed with me 
Sometimes, tears suddenly pour down with no reason 
The life I wished for, the life I wanted, a so-so life 
Whatever it is, it doesn’t matter anymore 
For just one day, without any concerns, 
for just one day, without any worries, 
to live, to live, to live 
Perhaps, I’m gradually becoming an adult 
I can’t remember 
What are the things that I hoped for 
Now I’m scared

Note: In Korea, when someone gets out of jail, friends and/or family would hand them a fresh block of tofu to eat. The reasons are: (1) Tofu is white and therefore symbolizes rehabilitation. (2) Prisoners are fed rice with beans in jail. Tofu, which is a new form of food made of beans, therefore symbolizes rehabilitation. (3) Tofu is nutritious and could help prisoners who might be suffering from malnutrition.

Note: Alternatively, the lyrics can be “Feel like a torso,” where the torso ( 
the trunk of a statue without the head and limbs) describes (1) his stiff/tired body or (2) his being lifeless/spiritless.

In addition to the fact that the city is filled with concrete buildings, fine dust levels have been soaring in South Korea, contributing to the “ashy expression.” Grey/ashy might also describe the mundane, colorless city life  
(1) Han is a mix of sorrow, nostalgia, anger, pain, and hope, as explained in this reddit post. Han rhymes with Han Rivers, although the meanings are completely different (Han, emotions, uses 恨, whereas Han in Han River uses 漢).
(2) As of 2016, the suicide rate in South Korea is the 10th highest in the world (according to WHO) and the 2nd highest among OECD countries (according to OECD). There have been many that threw themselves into the Han River. Mapo Bridge, which was infamous for attracting many jumpers, has been named “Bridge of Life” and started displaying encouraging messages along the parapet.
(3) When I was transcribing the lyrics, I first thought it is 한을 품”은,” not 한을 품”는.” This simple difference changes the nuance completely. When one says “너무 많은 한을 품은 한강들 (Han rivers that contain so much Han),” it’s a description of a static status. When one says, instead, “너무 많은 한을 품는 한강들 (Han rivers that take so much Han within),” it’s a description of an ongoing situation. 
그네들 [geunedeul], which I translated as swings, can also be “they; those people” 
is a stream running through downtown Seoul from east to west, which provides a large public recreation space. People would  
 or, in summer,  
.
Update: I learned that the city of Seoul now prohibits outdoor alcohol consumption at 청계천 (since July 2018). 
Seonyudo Park is an ecological water park located in the middle of Yanghwadaegyo (one of the bridges connecting the northern and southern sides of Seoul that are separated by Han River; this is the same Yanghwa bridge as in Zion.T’s Yanghwa BRDG). As a former water purification plant, Seonyudo Park offers various gardens and sculptures that utilize the old facilities. The park indeed looks very forlorn and lonesome when visited in late fall and winter.","In the cold morning air, 
I open my eyes without anyone’s knowing 
The  of this city– 
it’s so familiar to me 
Though my childhood days are far away

now this is my home 
 
Why would it be that your pronunciation is similar to  
What kind of soul is it that you possess 
What is it that holds me by your side like this 
I don’t even have memories of you 
I’m now so sick of you 
The same old, ashy facial expression of yours
 
No, no, I’m afraid of myself 
because I have already become a part of you

A bus that changes its scenery even when I’m still 
and buildings that look similar but a bit different from each other 
The scent of life that feels disgusting or not 
and cold parks that pretend to be warm
 
People that always have to wander, 
Han rivers that take so much Han within, 
swings that can’t see the sky by themselves,
 
grown-up children, 
and me who came a bit late 
Friends easily say that they’ll leave 
Though I try nodding my head, I can’t smile 
Though I hate to admit it, 
I love everything of you, even your fumes and disgusting side 
I love the fishy scent of Cheonggyecheon 
I love the lonesomeness of Seonyudo 
and even the sigh of a taxi driver who said it’s a good place to live as long as you have money

could be seen as the “thorns” of street lamps. 
“Life is a tragedy when seen in close-up, but a comedy in long-shot,” said Charlie Chaplin. Buildings with lights on, bridges with fancy lightings, running cars– they all make up a beautiful night scenery when we look at them from a distance. Zooming into corners of the scenery, it’s people working in their office at night, taxi drivers who are taking their passengers to home while they themselves can’t go home, and people who can’t fall asleep. Thorns are what make up a beautiful night scenery. ","

[C] 
[R] 
[C] 
This song maybe is the one that allows the most subjective transcription/interpretation with the absence of official lyrics. 내게 (naege; to me) and 네게 (nege; to you) are pronounced practically the same (technically, they are pronounced different, but it is very hard to differentiate the pronunciations), which makes listeners to also hear the above four lines as: “But, I still want to cross the bridge and reach you, the real you, the real you.” In previous BTS lyrics (especially in the Love Yourself series), there are cases where the distinction between “I” and “you” is vague. So this also might be on the extended line where the real you is actually the real me (as a listener of “me” the speaker). 
[R] 
You are expected to get all A’s in your life, but that’s just an expectation. You can receive B’s in your life, and that’s fine.  
비 (rain)  
is pronounced as “bi,” rhyming with B in the above two lines. In this verse, rain represents some uncontrollable forces in life.  
In the above four lines, it seems like RM is ready to accept the reality and embrace the imperfections, but here he starts to think about the ideal again. 
Here, again, the ideal me in my head is called “you”

because I’d like someone to cry for me 
I wish it rains all day 
because then people would not stare at me  
because the umbrella would cover the sad face 
because, in the rain, everyone is busy on their own  
I’m going to breathe a little slower 
because my life and my rap– they are all too fast in my every day 
Right now, everything goes back to its original place 
My shadow is getting reflected in the sky, 
and I’m standing on the darkness 
I put my head down to my heels

When it rains, I, a bit, 
feel like I have a friend 
It keeps knocking on my windows 
and asks me how I’m doing 
And I answer 
I’m still the hostage of life 
Though it’s not that I’m living because I can’t die, 
I’m still chained to something 
If only I could knock on somewhere like you, 
if I could kiss the whole world deeply, 
would someone welcome me? 
Would someone embrace my weary body? 
Please don’t ask me anything 
Just keep coming down forever 
When you come down, I don’t feel lonely 
Please stay by my side, at least you 
I want to live in an ashy world, 
knowing that there is no such thing as eternity

 with the youth (15-29 years of age) unemployment rate at 9.8% in 2017 according to the Ministry of Employment and Labor. This is a result of many intertwined factors including population structure, historic/institutional/structural characteristic, and economic conditions. The government has been trying to create public jobs and provide various aids to assist young job seekers, but the policies are so far ineffective.
For J-Hope who was 23 when he released this track, the youth unemployment issue and the resulting struggle of his contemporaries might have been the most straightforward motivation as he was writing about his hope to deliver a piece of peace.

Daydream (백일몽),Hope World,3/2/2018,"My character is half and half, who knows? 
A life I strive through as a public figure, who knows? 
Restraining my large appetite, who knows? 
Always getting out of breath from daydreaming, who knows?  
That I want to cry in peace, I know 
That I want to party like crazy, I know 
That I want to feel my heart fluttering with love, I know 
Ye I know I know I know, Cause Me 
Everyone must have caught like fish 
in a net called desire that results from the thirst in life 
Universal psychological escape 
Even I cannot swim out of it 
Not, denial of reality, 
dissatisfaction, maladaptation– 
It’s not any of them

It’s just that for once I want to draw a different picture of my life

Sleep

Wake up","사랑꾼 (sarang-kkun) is a combined word of 사랑 (sarang; love) and 꾼 (kkun; a noun ending for a person who enjoys or is good at something) and therefore means someone who values love and loves with all their heart. It’s only a letter different from 사냥꾼 (sanyang-kkun; hunter) where 사냥 (sanyang) means hunting, which explains why J-hope used the particular word of 저격 (jeogyeok; sniping).   
I’ve checked the official translation provided in the music video, “I’ll sound like bragging,” but it is not quite what 배부른 소리 means. 배부른 소리, when translated directly, means a remark made with one’s stomach filled. When someone says 배부른 소리, therefore, the person is wishing to have more when they already have all their needs (and some of their wants) fulfilled.","My character is

Agust D spelled in Backward is D tsugA, which is a combination of DT (D-Town, Daegu) and SUGA.

A literal translation would be “the jealousy of hyungs who will lose their rice bowl” 밥그릇 is a rice bowl that also means someone’s job or a source of income.
 
삽질하다 literally means “to shovel” but is also used as a slang to describe someone messing up their job or wasting their time. Suga is using both meanings in the above two lines. By wasting their time and shoveling, they are digging their own grave and ruining their career.

would say it doesn’t want a genius like this? 
From the company’s point, yo, it was a luck coming their way on its own

A Daegu hillbilly acting tough 
I ate out that night, acting cool

My monthly living expense budget was only 300,000 won, shit 
Because I knew better than anyone else that this was nowhere enough, 
I started working part-time in the early morning, uh 
So I always went to school at different times, uh 
At school, all the kids are from rich families 
They waste many times my monthly living expense on alcohol  
And they fucking said what? what? All pretended that they had no money 
Shut the fuck up, asshole, shut your fucking mouth

They drive import cars they got as graduation gifts 
For that, I’m a bit envious

The literal translation is, “well, that is just rice.” Rice or gum (chewing gum) is often used to describe a task that is very easy in Korea. 
02 is the area code of Seoul. 
기선 제압 (to get a head start, to take the lead in a battle) reminds of me (and probably does have its reference at)  
 “랩 댄스 노래로 상대방의 기선을 제압해 (Knock out your opponent with rap, dance, and singing).” 
15 pyeong is approximately 49.5 sqm or 533 sqft.","Few years after I started fooling around, saying that I do music 
“If I do music in Daegu, at best I’ll end up running some music cram school.” 
— the thought hit me hard 
I only live once, so I should be number one at something at least once 
Number one that I could never be with studying 
I thought I could be with music 
Around me, eight or nine out of ten said, 
“This brat is bullshitting again” 
Fuck you, bastard, watch me carefully, you’re lost again 
Anyway, I thought I needed to first leave Daegu to do music in style,

needlessly pretending that I’m okay, and pretending hard that I’m strong,

마지막 (The Last),Agust D,8/15/2016,"Behind a successful idol rapper 
stands my weak self, a bit dangerous 
Depression and compulsion sometimes flare up 
hell no 
Maybe that’s my true self 
Damn huh feeling of separation from the reality 
Conflict with ideals My head hurts 
It was when I was about 18 that my social phobia developed 
Yeah it was about then that my mind became polluted more and more 
Sometimes I’m afraid of myself 
Thanks to self-hatred and depression that came to play again 
Min Yoongi has already died (I killed him) 
It’s been a long time since it became my daily life to compare my dead passion to others 
On my first visit to a psychiatrist, my parents came to Seoul and had a consultation with me 
My parents said they didn’t know me well 
I don’t know myself well either. Then who would know? (Who knows?) 
Friend? If not, you? Nobody knows me well 
The doctor asked me (Have you ever -beep-) 
Without hesitation, I answered that I have 
I say like a habit uh I don’t give a shit I don’t give a fuck 
All those words uh are to hide my weak self 
The time that I want to erase, yeah, it was on a day of some performance that I can’t even remember 
I faced myself who got afraid of people and hid in the washroom 
Back then I, back then I, 
thought that success would make it all worth it 
But then, but then, 
It feels like I’m becoming a monster as time passes 
The monster, my success earned at the cost of my youth, wants greater wealth 
The greed that used to be my weapon now swallows me, ruins me, and puts a leash around my neck 
Some people stop my mouth and ask me to swallow the forbidden fruit 
I don’t want it 
They want me to leave this garden 
Shit shit I get it so please stop 
The cause of all these problems is me, so let me quit by myself 
If my misfortune is your happiness, I’ll gladly be unfortunate 
If the target of your hatred is me, I will step onto the guillotine for you 
Things I had only imagined became reality 
My childhood dream is in front of my eyes 
A little shit who used to perform in front of two people 
Now Tokyo dome is in front of my nose 
I only live once, so I live harder than anyone 
Living half-heartedly can be done by anyone 
My fan, my hommie, my fam, don’t worry I’m really okay now damn 
I denied my essence multiple times 
My address is idol, I don’t deny it 
The anguish that dug into my mind multiple times 
At the end of my wandering, there was no answer 
My pride that I thought I had sold now becomes my self-respect 
My fans, keep your head up proudly Who else would do as much as I do? uh 
From Seiko to Rolex, from Ax  to Gymnastics  
Tens of thousands nod to one hand gesture of mine

Those who used to sell us out, it’s not that you didn’t do it, you couldn’t do it shit 
The root of my creation is Han  
I have tasted the world’s sweetness, bitterness, and even shit 
The time when I tried to sleep on a bathroom floor is now a memory to me uh it became a memory

From Seiko to Rolex, from Ax  to Gymnastics

목소리 (Voice),RM,3/20/2015,"I didn’t have a dream 
It was like that every day just like my lyrics 
Functions and equations that couldn’t give me any answer 
They eventually became many harms 
With that light, they prevent me from seeing the stars hiding behind them
 
Killing myself day by day like that, 
I occupied myself all day with being graded with meaningless numbers like beef gets graded 
I just wanted to succeed 
because that’s the only thing I was told by others so much that I almost got sick of it 
The mirage called happiness- I thought it would be held there 
But, sitting at my desk, I was never happy, not for a single moment 
I secretly hid a blank sheet of paper between the pages of my studybook without my mom’s knowing 
My identity that I wrote down along the sound of drums and bass 
The feeling of breathing that is different from that of receiving grade reports 
Even when I was the top of my class, my mind was never at ease 
Is it absolutely necessary to want something that others want? 
Rather than spending my whole life letting out sighs of Han, 
I chose the path where I take Han out and live by simply breathing
 
All the shallow people around me pointed their fingers at me 
My dream is to give my voice to everyone, 
no matter how I look and where I am, with my music and lyrics 
I don’t know how you’d feel listening to this, 
but it’s okay even if you curse at me because you’ll eventually look for me again 
Yeah, though seven years have passed, still with a ₩50,000 mic, 
this mixtape that is created by me alone in a corner of my room 
Some say I’m fake, yeah I admit my shameful past
 
I can make excuses, but I won’t.  
Such a thing will never happen again 
Yeah I be real 
This moment, the thing that I wanted desperately- 
I’m finally oiling the pedals that I’ve been stepping on for seven years 
You can’t kill 
Come take it if you do wanna piece of me 
I only speak through music, I have no interest in anything else 
If you really think you ready to fly with my power 
This is what R is about, fella the time is now

I secretly raise the volume of my voice 
so that you can know so that it can reach you 
I again raise the volume of my voice 
so that you can know so that it can reach you ","Note on the wordplay used for the previous three lines:  
해 (pronounced as hae) could be interpreted in many different ways, and I can think of three interpretations that are most relevant in this context. (1) given that the first line talked about functions and equations, it could be 해 (解), the value of an unknown variable of an equation. (2) It could be 해 (害), which means harm/damage. Lastly, (3) the sun. My interpretation thus is: “Functions and equations couldn’t give me any 해 (解; answer) but only became many 해 (害; harm) to prevent me from seeing the stars hiding behind them with that light of 해 (the sun).” 
As explained in 마지막 (The Last), 한 (Han) is a mix of sorrow, nostalgia, anger, pain, and hope. It’s the emotional journey and state of mind of someone who has been gravely wronged but is powerless (made powerless) in society to take revenge but decides eventually to cling to the hope of a better future when you overcome your Han. (credit: /u/lagamine86 of r/bangtan). Here, RM is separating 한숨 (sigh; pronounced as hansoom) into 한 (Han) and 숨 (breath). Taking 한 (Han) away from 한숨 (sigh; hansoom), he is left with only 숨 (breath; soom), which lets him live by simply breathing rather than constantly sighing. 
Word-to-word translation of 흑역사 is dark history, which refers to (a certain period in) one’s past that is so shameful that s/he wants to rather forget it. 
The above two lines are variations of lyrics from Nas’ One Mic.","I didn’t have a dream

“아프니까 청춘이다” is a book published in 2010 by Kim Nando in his attempt to comfort the youth who are suffer from the uncertainty of the future. This book was initially received very well and made to a best-seller, but the title was criticized for normalizing the pain and struggle that the contemporaneous youth has to go through. Some even made jokes by saying, “Pain doesn’t prove your youth. Pain means you should go to the hospital.” 
Trap here is a device that catch/retain animals, not 
 a genre of music.  
Quoted from people who accused BTS for being “idols, not artists,” who wear make-ups, skinny jeans, and other “girly” things that are “not hip hop.” 
(1) Hongdae, as explained in  
, is an abbreviation of Hongik Daehakgyo (University) and also refers to the area nearby. The area is known for its indie music culture, nightlife, arts, and so on. 
(2) Double entendre: 바지 내리는 것들 can also be interpreted as those pulling their pants down (to engage in sexual activities).

Arthur Rimbaud was a French poet and a major figure in symbolism. “A Season in Hell” is a book of poem that he wrote when he was 19 (he completely stopped writing at age 21) and is arguably the most influential work of his. The book carries a deep reflection on life, and his conclusion often reaches denial and despair. RM raps “four seasons in hell,” instead of “a season in hell.” This could mean that he had spent the previous year desperately reflecting on his life, or could also literally mean that he had spend the previous year in hell (figuratively), since 2014-2015 is the period when BTS received the most hatred from antis and some “hip hop artists”. Option 2 to interpret this is to read 네 as “your” instead of “four.” Then it becomes “A season of yours in hell,” which to me sound less coherent. Option 3 is to read 보낸 as “sent” instead of “spent” and read 철 as “discretion/sense/maturity” instead of “season.” Then it becomes “Your discretion sent off in hell.” I’d like to stick to Option 1. ","At the moment I fall,

181 (cm) and 68 (kg), long arms and legs like a model‘s 
A better brain than stupid hyungs’ and an open mind 
You guys will defame me for a variety of reasons 
But I howl, now I’m a grown Simba 
I live every day like I’m crazy, my calendar is always December 
Soon you’ll also know, a symbol that lives up to its name 
I’m still RAP MONSTER, you immediately diss me 
Yeah, from intro to outro 
I sweep up all your ears 
Instead of those idiots who don’t understand even if I spoon-feed them, 
hyungs who know the style, come gather here quickly 
RM‘s emotion that explodes 
cannot be described by any lengthy explanations 
What whipped me who was innocent 
is the careless chitchats of those fuckers 
My spirit that doesn’t change during the change of seasons 
You’ll get to live with me all day, I’m a sneeze 
Another name is indigestion, so mufuckin check it 
Pathetic lives, just play LOL while I rap this 
Left side (c’mon!)

You live, they leavin i spit right im heaven 
Sick of your gimic so get right you bitches 
I eat up your high pride, I’m a giraffe standing outside the house 
If I make a sound, even all the men stand upright 
My debt, I owe it myself, I pay it back myself, I guarantee it myself 
When you play LOL, you know i play roles 
Rapper, composer, a star so lay low (I fuck you up) 
The problem gets bigger like your message to one-sided love 
You’ll all get completely wet, so make sure to bring an extra underwear    
I’ve diligently walked like this for 7 years, and now the path gets cleared up for me 
Diss me while you can, you’re a loser who only worries about others’ lives  
Oh shit.. that was childish 
Don’t worry, I live a fucking good life 
Singapore today, Taiwan tomorrow, bitch 
I’m so busy poppin’ tags, you so busy shoutin’ nags bitch 
Left side (c’mon!) 
Right side (c’mon!)

I glue the mouth of those bastards who are poor in spirit  
so that they can’t talk anymore 
Why do you smack your lips again? 
They say it’s just fun to chew me, tear me apart, and taste me 
Low-life, bitch, comfort yourself like that if that helps 
Yeah, ‘Hiphop, hiphop~’ is all you have, what else can you do 
Bastards like traffic jams, my rap ain’t for you 
My music ain’t for everybody, especially not for you

[ssibeo] 
씹다 can mean (i) to chew or (ii) to speak ill of someone. 
One of the ways to read 18 is sib-pal (the other being yeol-yeodeol), which makes a sound similar to si-bal (or ssi-bal) that basically corresponds to “fucking.” 놈 (nom) is a derogatory word to address a guy. 
hwanjeolgi ganjeolgi galiji anhneun nae paegi 
dalgo salge dwae nal halu jong-il, nan jaechaegi 

It is said that people are more prone to catch a cold between seasons because the temperature will be changing unpredictably. Because RM’s spirit won’t change during the change of seasons, he will be able to harass his enemies like sneezes do to sick people.

콧대 높은 (literally means “having a sharp nose”) is used when describing someone who is conceited. 따먹다 means (1) to win, (2) to pick something (a fruit) off a tree and eat, or (3) (vulgar slang) to have a sexual intercourse (taking someone’s chastity or virginity). 
곧추서 [gotchuseo; stand upright] sounds similar to 고추서 [gochuseo] where 고추 means a pepper, which also is a slang for a dick. So another way to interpret the line is, “If I make a sound, even all the men get erections.”  
 [iri] 
일 can mean (1) 1 (number 1) and (2) task, problem, or issue. When you message someone on KakaoTalk (a smartphone messenger app that most Koreans use), there’s a “1” next to your message until the recipient reads the message. If it’s a one-sided love, and your crush is not interested in reading the message (or is ignoring the message), the “1” will never disappear. And for you, waiting for them to read the message, the “1” will look like it’s growing larger and larger in size. Just like that, the problem/issue will only get bigger.

Wordplay: 연금술사 (鍊金術師; pronounced as yeongeumsoolsa) means alchemist. He changed 연 (鍊; pronounced as yeon, meaning “to refine”) to 언 (言; pronounced as eon, meaning “word, saying”). While 언금술사 (言金術師) doesn’t make any sense literally, he is telling that like an alchemist who converts anything into gold, he is capable of delivering any emotion through lyrics.  
Wordplay: 입에 풀칠하다 (to cover your lips/mouth with soup made of starch) is an idiom that means to maintain a hand-to-mouth existence. Because 풀 can mean (1) glue and (2) soup made of starch, it also can be interpreted as “to glue one’s mouth.” 
Reference: “씹고 뜯고 맛보고 즐기고 (chew, tear apart, taste, and enjoy)” is actually a famous commercial catchphrase of 이가탄, a medicine used for periodontitis. 
자위 (自慰) 하다 means (1) to comfort oneself and (2) to masturbate. 
추석 (Chuseok; Korean Thanksgiving) 귀성길 (the way back to one’s hometown during traditional holidays) means a really bad traffic jam since everyone residing in Seoul and its suburbs. Seoul is home to about 20% of the total population, and the Seoul Capital Area is home to almost 50% of the national population although it covers only about 10% of total area. Many would travel back to their hometown or where their parents are during traditional holidays, causing severe traffic jams. Bastards like traffic jams can mean (1) those whose minds are closed and blocked or (2) those who block RM’s way.","21 years old, a fully grown-up son of my mom

눈이 뒤집히다 (eyeballs are flipped) is an idiom used when someone goes insane after getting shocked or getting extremely angry, which makes it interesting to be followed by “go sane.” It could be interpreted as “stay sane by preparing yourself to go insane.”

Idiom: 젊어서 고생은 사서도 한다 (When young, you’d even pay money to go through hardships) because the lessons learned from hardships when young are invaluable as you live the rest of your life.

Notice how he pronounces hundred to make it rhyme with honey 
Word-to-word translation is beggar-like motherfucker 
턱걸이 (pull-up) in Korean has two meaning: (1) pull-up (an exercise), (2) barely succeeding at something; “make them do something challenging and watch them barely make it and fuck themselves up” 
“Two different things with one mouth” is something that has been traditionally tabooed for men in Korea. There are even old sayings such as 남아일언중천금 (男兒一言重千金; a real guy’s one word carries the weight of a thousand pieces of gold). It is obviously an outcome of gender-biased prejudice, but is still widely used. Some would jokingly call a man who changes his word “a woman.” With that said, “girls call you unnie” because “you” said two different things from one mouth. “Since you spoke two different things with one mouth, you’re not a real man. So, I’m going to treat you as a woman, and those girls will call you unnie.” 
Lee Kun-hee is the chairman of Samsung Group 
Hongdae is an abbreviation of Hongik Daehakgyo (University) and also refers to the area nearby. Hongdae area is known for its indie music culture, clubs, arts, and so on. A lot of indie artists, including hiphop artists, hold their concerts, which are described in a derogatory manner as “Hongdae entertainment show”, in this area. ‘힙수니 (힙순이 = 힙합hiphop + 순이 soon-ee, a common female name in the past),’ which means hiphop fangirls, seems to be a counterattack to some rapper(s) who said that BTS is followed by 빠순이 (= 오빠 oppa + 순이 soon-ee). 빠순이 (pronounced as bbasooni) is a demeaning word referring to hardcore female fans of male celebrities. 
개폐인 can be broken in two ways: (1) 개/폐인 (廢人): a fucking wasted person, (2) 개폐 (開閉)/인: who/that is open and shut (given the previous sentence, ‘I open and close the door,’ this is an intended double-meaning) 
“You can only talk dirty but I have an actual ability write lyrics.” 
5 gwang (five brights) is a way of collecting points in a Korean card game called Go-Stop or Hwatu (Hwatu is also the name of cards themselves). It’s similar to having four aces in poker. 
The last line ‘Six shots got me feelin’ 2pac’ is indeed taken from A$AP Rocky’s ‘Wild For The Night (ft. Skrillex, Birdy Nam Nam),’ ‘Six shots got me feelin’ like Pac.’ Six bullets, six snakes, and six shots might all refer to the other six members of BTS who empower RM. 
별거 can be interpreted in two ways: (1) a special thing, (2) separation (別居). A happily married couple would not separate, but the real message is “you don’t have anything special.” 
천상 여자 is a colloquial term (with the correct term being 천생 여자) referring to a woman with qualities or appearance traditionally associated with women: modest, quiet, kind, good at cooking, and so on. 
See how 설 거 없지 (seor geo eoptji; has nothing to be erect) and 설거지 (seolgeoji; dishwashing) rhyme 
촌장님 can be broken in two ways: (1) 촌장/님: head of a countryside village –nim, (2) 촌/장님: a blind person in the countryside 
He pronounces 혹 (hog) almost as 욕 (yog), which means swear word. 꼰대 is a slang word for an old man who is stuck with his own values (usually of the past) and tries to teach/govern young people’s behaviors. 족발(jokbal) is a traditional Korean dish consisting of pig’s feet cooked with soy sauce and spices. 
Reference: lyrics from Forever by Drake, Kanye West, Lil Wayne & Eminem; “Last name Ever—first name Greatest” 
갑, which will be further explained later, can be used to refer to someone in a superior position. 깝 is a slang describing behaviors so energetic and overly enthusiastic to the extent that they’re almost annoying. 밥, meaning rice or food, can be used to describe someone who’s inferior or something that’s too easy. 짭 is a slang that means fake. 
Word-to-word translation of ‘just suck a dick’ will be ‘please bare your dick and eat it.’ 
The first 적 (敵; jeog) means enemy, and the second 적 (籍; jeog) means somewhere one belongs to (or is registered under). While 적 까 is translated as ‘reveal where you belong,’ it’s noteworthy that 적 (jeog) and 좆 (jot; dick) sound similar. As explained in the previous line, 까 (original form: 까다) means to bare, which makes 적 까 sound similar to 좆 까 (bare your dick), which basically means to fuck yourself or fuck off. 
나가리 (nagari) is a Japanese-originated slang for being canceled or no longer considered as a valid option, and so on. 노가리 (nogari) is dried little Pollack that is often consumed as snack. 
노답 is a slang that combines ‘no’ and 답(dap; answer) and is used to describe a situation or a person where there is no answer/solution. 
Some background information before moving onto the next four lines: there’s an old hierarchy system (technically it can be used for some other purposes, but we abstract from them here) called 천간 (天干; cheongan) or 십간 (十干; sibgan) with the order (in descending power): 갑(甲), 을(乙), 병(丙), 정(丁), 무(戊), 기(己), 경(庚), 신(辛), 임(壬), and 계(癸). 갑, appeared above, is the most superior and is often used to describe someone or something with power, authority, great quality, or great ability in doing something. 
Here, I interpret 갑질 as 갑 (best) + 질 (vagina), given that it follows ‘the best woman.’ 
갑질 itself is a slang (with 질 meaning behavior or activity), which is widely-used in recent years due to improper power abuse of chaebols and the resulting social outrage. It means a behavior of a person in a superior position forcing another person in an inferior position to perform unreasonable requests.  
임 (im) itself means dear (lover). By replacing 갑 with 임, 갑질 becomes 임질, which essentially means gonorrhea. If we, however, stick to the word composition of 갑질, take 임 and 질 apart from each other, and interpret 임 as 임 (壬) in the천간 system and 질 as behavior/activity, 임질 becomes a behavior/activity of 임 (壬), which means someone who is sly and adulates his superiors. It’s also the second to last in the hierarchy order. 
자비 can be interpreted in two ways: (1) 자비 (慈悲): mercy, (2) 자비 (自費): one’s own expense. A jobless person would not be able to afford anything out of his own pocket, but the real message is “I don’t have any mercy for you.” 
Stitch is a title character of the Lilo & Stitch and is an illegal genetic experiment created by mad alien scientist.","The rhythm that makes my eardrums vibrate 
, the fuel that makes me move 
All the happiness that exist here and even your new year’s luck,  
I’m Elastin, and you guys are dandruff
 
Rap cripples, your levels are all-alike 
fame, girls, 
that ma

Who’s going to stop me  
Leech-like , they kill me, they tie me, they silence me 
im so super i juss grew up 
Crappy , mix them all and break their wrists and ankles
 
Make them do circus, make them do pull-ups, they all  
Two different things with one mouth, girls call you ‘unnie’
 
You get brazen-faced too easily. In your songs, you’re acting as if you’re Lee Kun-hee
 
Eh, girls are swarming more than flies  
Stop it, I can clearly see your reality 
At your Hongdae entertainment show, your regulars are those few hiphop fangirls
 
I open and close the door of this place like a fucking wasted person
 
The  that you insist that you feel every day 
I conquer the beat in a flash 
When seeing you, the beats talk, “beat him” 
You must envy my so much that your stomach gets twisted 
Sweden, Germany, Brazil,  Japan 
My pen is stronger than your dirty tongue
 
Now I get to reveal my card that is even better than ‘5 gwang’
 
Got six bullets in my tongue 
Six snakes in my lung 
Six shots got me feelin’ 2pac 
Yeah, these are A$AP’s lyrics
 
You don’t have anything special like a happily married couple.
 
Like a real woman, you don’t have anything to be erect.
 
I’m a duster, beating the dust like , sweeping it off Like water, my tongue washes dishes
 
This is meaningless wordplay,  
i got a mufuckin beat i got a mufuckin rhyme 
i got a mufuckin flow i got a mufuckin style 
i got a mufuckin wine i got a mufuckin shine 
How many bars does my  have 
Bitch im the one im so mufuckin prime 
You guys are fucking unsophisticated, village chiefs
 
An old man’s style, loving hog or Jokbal
 
Bitch im your man. 10 outta 10 
My heart is black, a mid-summer’s suntan 
Let’s begin the operation, yeah, the brand of my name 
I do it all by myself, the band of my name 
This is an amusement park that I build,  lever 
Even from the roots, there’s a difference between my and your levels 
My real name is  and my surname is  
I won’t every request name change, I’ll  
Yeah, dude, you’re acting up rather than owning it, being eaten up rather than topping the food pyramid, being fake rather than being the answer
 
When you watch porn, you come in 3 seconds 
I’m , the ruler of rulers, the answer of answers 
All the sunbaes and hoobaes go back 
Just suck a dick, have it, it’s delicious
 
Yeah, you’re my enemy, so reveal where you belong!
 
Day and night, fucking hardworking 
You bastard can only rap in three-syllables, you go like-

Yours is cancelled, just eat up some dried fish
 
Is your name Mimi, ? You’re impossible.
 
My rap is a rap that goes off completely 
Your rap? Let me say just one thing,  rap 
Mine is a rap played in big waters 
Yours is really not a rap,  
Yeah, you’re the best woman, best vagina
 
 you’re fucking good at bossing around
 
Ah, but, thinking about it, you were never really that powerful 
I’ll take ‘power’ off and call you ‘dear,’ gonorrhea
 
I pop it rock it knock it never stop it talkin some trashes 
I’m jobless, so I don’t have mercy. You’re jobless, so you don’t have bus fare.
 
You know i aint about the thousands let me ride it yo drop it swap it 
rock it mock it stalk it lock it in my pocket theres full of monsters 
Yeah i gettin on em bitch gettin on em rich

God Rap,RM,3/20/2015,"Amen 
Thank God that I can live 
Thank God that I can breathe 
Thank God that I can spit 
Thank God that I can dream 
I can see this beautiful yet hideously ugly world 
I can snore even when someone else is dying 
I know only myself, yeah always, no matter I’m happy or sad 
When someone asks me who I’d want to born as in the next life, I’d choose myself 
I can tell ya, if I fail to prove myself, 
spit on my grave after I drop dead 
Fuck you this is my own god rappin’ 
It’s okay even if I fail to be a die legend cuz I’m my legend 
Do you know that fire doesn’t cast a shadow? 
Then my question is whether you’d be a fire or a light 
I’ll become a firelight and, during the day, I’ll become a darkness 
I briefly close my eyes when it’s bright and open them again when everyone else is asleep 
Even the fact that I feel the pain, I thank you 
If there’s someone called a god, I tell you 
Yo, this is god rap 
I don’t have such thing as a religion because my god is myself 
No matter what trial comes to me, I put my two hands together 
and say it to myself, Amen Amen Amen 
I once used to be just a rapper wannabe like you, 
easily slandering and easily worshiping anyone like a cult religion follower 
Perhaps that’s how I wanted to comfort myself in my reality 
because I was just an amateur rapper 
That I’m different, that my taste ain’t cheap, 
I rejected almost everyone because I thought that was cool 
Back then and now, I still want faith in the same way 
I was blind back then, but now I have seen myself 
The thing that saves me, the enemy that pushes me, 
the endless sheer drop, they are all me 
Foolish human, you can also become a god
 
Hold your head up and put the smile of the Buddha on your face 
The steps of Jesus, the prayers of Allah, 
the love of Maria, they are all in you 
This is unconditional salvation and unconditional belief 
I’m my own god, my own world, my every symbol 
Yo, this is god rap 
I don’t have such thing as a religion because my god is myself 
No matter what trial comes to me, I put my two hands together 
and say it to myself, Amen Amen Amen","Wordplay (continued from the previous line): 불빛 (where 불 means fire and 빛 means light) is literally a light coming from a fire (or any source of lighting, to be more general). Because he is a “god,” instead of having to choose between fire and light, he can choose to become both. 
중생 (衆生; pronounced joongsaeng) is a Buddism terminology, meaning every living creature. In Buddism, it is said that every person has Buddha-nature within them that enables them to reach enlightenment and become a Buddha themselves. ","

Life,RM,3/20/2015,"I felt after drinking up a glass of alcohol 
that to live is to continue to learn about the loneliness 
No matter how many people are there, or not there at all, around me, 
the little me inside me was always lonely 
Why would there be no antonym of loneliness 
Perhaps it’s because we never have a moment of no-loneliness until we die 
Even if there’s a time when it feels like our surrounding overflows with an uproarious crowd, 
there surely comes a moment when we need to be alone
 
Yeah that’s a life 
We live in danger 
in return for being able to see this beautiful world 
Even bulletproof vests, streetlights, and sturdy cars  
can never perfectly hide us from death 
Life is more beautiful because everyone has their death as a collateral from the moment they are born 
just like a light can truly be a light only in darkness 
just like the sun shines after a rough storm 
Life, fall in love 
Life gets hurt by people 
and feels lonely by the blowing wind 
We wanna be right 
but always wrong 
Were we born to be wrong? 
Perhaps that’s what a life is 
(What it’ll be like tomorrow, we never know for our entire life) 
(We can’t avoid it even if this building is going to collapse) 
We tryna be bright 
but always dark 
Though we think we’ve lived enough, 
we still don’t know 
The world is a decalcomanie 
A friend who I thought was on my side would change into a even more vicious enemy 
It’s all over once we end our relationship like how we’d fold a paper
 
In no time, he’s sneering at me from the other side in the exact same way
 
But boy, there’s no reason for you to get angry 
Some parents don’t even care about their own children when it comes to money 
We have to burn into a rising flame because the world is too cold 
So that no one can freeze us, though we might harm ourselves
 
Maybe there is no such thing as right or wrong 
But what we have always been taught  
is to step on somebody, catch somebody, erase somebody, and hate somebody 
Fuck all the peace and love, I know that they are the natural enemy of success 
Those quotes that are so naturally talked about as if they are the truth 
make me even sadder 
But what can I do, I’m just all talk as well 
I’m just a wind that brushes past someone 
Life, fall in love 
Life gets hurt by people 
and feels lonely by the blowing wind 
We wanna be right 
but always wrong 
Were we born to be wrong? 
Perhaps that’s what a life is 
Were we born to live 
Were we born to die 
Were we born to live 
Were we born to die 
Am I living to die 
Am I dying to live 
The nametag on my name- 
would that be life 
or death 
Who knows.. 
Life, fall in love 
Life gets hurt by people 
and feels lonely by the blowing wind 
We wanna be right 
but always wrong 
Were we born to be wrong? 
Perhaps that’s what a life is 
(What it’ll be like tomorrow, we never know for our entire life) 
(We can’t avoid it even if this building is going to collapse) 
We tryna be bright 
but always dark 
Though we think we’ve lived enough, 
we still don’t know","This part really describes the feeling of being “alone in the crowd.”  
I’m also linking 작은 나 (little me) above to a concept in Buddhism: 소아 (小我; little self) as opposed to 대아 (大我; great self). Basically “little self” is me as an individual whereas “great self” is me as a part of larger social bodies. It may not be something RM had in mind when writing the lyrics, but it randomly hit me. 
Wordplay: 접다 can be (1) fold (a paper or a linen), (2) end or put aside (a project, a thought, etc.)  
“Decalcomanie.” RM must be laughing at him from this side in the exact same way as well. 
타올라야해 (burn and rise) can also be interpreted as 타고 올라야 해, meaning “climb up,” which, in the context, will make the above two lines read “We have to climb up the social ladder because the world is too cruel. Only by doing so we can prevent anyone from touching us, though we might harm ourselves.”","I felt after drinking up a glass of alcohol 
that to live is to continue to learn about the loneliness 
No matter how many people are there, or not there at all, around me, 
the little me inside me was always lonely 
Why would there be no antonym of loneliness 
Perhaps it’s because we never have a moment of no-loneliness until we die 
Even if there’s a time when it feels like our surrounding overflows with an uproarious crowd, 
there surely comes a moment when we need to be alone
 
Yeah that’s a life 
We live in danger 
in return for being able to see this beautiful world 
Even bulletproof vests, streetlights, and sturdy cars  
can never perfectly hide us from death 
Life is more beautiful because everyone has their death as a collateral from the moment they are born 
just like a light can truly be a light only in darkness 
just like the sun shines after a rough storm 
Life, fall in love 
Life gets hurt by people 
and feels lonely by the blowing wind 
We wanna be right 
but always wrong 
Were we born to be wrong? 
Perhaps that’s what a life is 
(What it’ll be like tomorrow, we never know for our entire life) 
(We can’t avoid it even if this building is going to collapse) 
We tryna be bright 
but always dark 
Though we think we’ve lived enough, 
we still don’t know 
The world is a decalcomanie 
A friend who I thought was on my side would change into a even more vicious enemy 
It’s all over once we end our relationship like how we’d fold a paper
 
In no time, he’s sneering at me from the other side in the exact same way
 
But boy, there’s no reason for you to get angry 
Some parents don’t even care about their own children when it comes to money 
We have to burn into a rising flame because the world is too cold 
So that no one can freeze us, though we might harm ourselves
 
Maybe there is no such thing as right or wrong 
But what we have always been taught  
is to step on somebody, catch somebody, erase somebody, and hate somebody 
, I know that they are the natural enemy of success 
Those quotes that are so naturally talked about as if they are the truth 
make me even sadder 
But what can I do, I’m just all talk as well 
I’m just a wind that brushes past someone 
Life, fall in love 
Life gets hurt by people 
and feels lonely by the blowing wind 
 
 
Were we born to be wrong? 
Perhaps that’s what a life is 
Were we born to live 
Were we born to die

I Believe (Ft. BTS),RM,3/20/2015,"I believe in me i believe in myself 
Even if time passes, i’ll be livin’ in myself 
Believe my faith believe my rap 
I believe my damn voice will one day be spread 
I’ve had times where I doubted my dream and my existence itself, 
but I’ve never doubted my voice so real 
In my world, I’m a God that not a deal 
If we were to talk with rankings, I’m 1 
How you feel babe, do you believe that you’re your own master? 
Are you balancing it well, the see-saw of reason and sense? 
Everyone wants to become their own leader 
But one has to believe in themselves, if they’re their own leader 
Bad thoughts and pessimistic rationalization are MSG 
You think they taste good, but they erase your real flavor 
We’re so used to look only outward, 
when the galaxy is inside me 
Wherever I am, whatever I do 
I believe I believe 
Wherever I am, I protect myself 
I believe I believe 
You know i believe in love, believe in hope 
Believe in thoughts that i got while i be livin this life 
Livin this stuff like breathin 
I, too, get confused sometimes about who the heck I am 
Sometimes I’m like an angel, sometimes I’m like a devil, 
but everything coexists- positivity and negativity 
What leads the world and me, after all, is the synergy between the two of them 
Even all the wanderings about my existence and even those moments that are so empty that they make me flustered seem lovable now 
When I get confused about what is right and what is wrong, 
I think about what makes me want to live again 
This muzik, passion, those beautiful places out there, and fashion 
Whisky to pretend that I’m a grown-up uh mom you kiss me 
I hope you make a meaning that you can rest yourself by leaning on it 
All the paths that are seemingly different but the same towards death

Still With You (Jungkook),SoundCloud,6/5/2020,"Your faint voice that brushes past me 
Please call my name just one more time 
Though I’m standing under the frozen sunset, 
I will walk towards you, one step at a time 
Still With You 
In the dark room without a single lighting 
Though I shouldn’t be used to it, 
it feels familiar again 
This subtle noise from the air conditioner 
If I don’t even have this, I think I’ll break down 
Laughing together, crying together 
These simple emotions, 
perhaps they were everything to me 
When would it be 
When I meet you again, 
I’ll look into your eyes and tell you 
“I’ve missed you” 
In the memories of entrancing moments, 
even if I dance alone, it still rains 
When this fog gets lifted up, 
I will run to you on my wet feet 
Hold me in your arms then 
Because that moon looked lonely 
Because it looked like it’s crying bright in the night sky 
Knowing that the morning would come sometime, 
I wanted to stay in your sky like a star 
That day, that moment, 
if I had known that if it would be like this, 
I would’ve kept more of them in my memories

Hey, this life of yours has no hope, you’re ddaeng [3]","The terms come from a Korean card game called 섰다 (pronounced as seot-da; colloquially spelled 섯다) that uses Hwatu (explained briefly in the lyric translation of 농담 (Joke)). A basic set of Hwatu (the cards) is comprised of 48 cards, 4 for each month. There are five ‘bright’ cards (gwang); one each from January (1), March (3), August (8), November (11), and December (12). When playing 섰다, players use only 20 cards: 2 for each month from January to October, including gwang cards from January (1), March (3), and August (8). Any combination of two gwang cards, which is called gwang ddaeng, gives you a very high chance of winning. One-Eight and One-Three are excellent combinations, but there’s one particular combination of cards (animal cards from April and July) that can beat One-Eight and One-Three. Three-Eight is the invincible combination that can’t be defeated by any other combination of cards. Basically, this line says BTS is invincible and can’t be defeated by anyone. 
There’s a children’s song in Korea called ‘School bell is ddaeng ddaeng ddaeng.’ ‘Ring a bell (to one’s life)’ is used to describe that someone is dead (figuratively, not literally), which makes a good transition to the next line. 
The above four lines sum up the criticism or hatred BTS has been receiving as ‘hip hop idols.’ Some people (including some hip hop artists; especially in the early days of BTS) denounced BTS saying that what BTS does cannot be labeled as hip hop since they are idols. 
AP stands for Audemars Piguet, a Swiss manufacturer of luxury mechanical watches. 
얘 (pronounced as yeh), literally, is a shortened form of 이 아이, meaning “this kid.” It could be used to casually call/address someone of the same age or younger. 
얘 (the listener; this kid) is haters, who got a lot of time because they don’t have anything to do other than hating BTS. 
[1] Your answer to the homework question is wrong. [3] Your problem is unsolvable. 
(1) “We all are wrong.”
 
(2) All BTS members are giving ‘ddaeng’ to ‘you guys.’ “We all think that you all are wrong.” 
The literal translation of this line is ‘whoever has a good 끗발,’ where 끗발 meaning a player constantly getting good cards in gambling. 끗 (kkeut) refers to the points in gambling. 
Because BTS has Three-Eight, the invincible pair of gwangs, it doesn’t matter whoever gets what. 
(1) In “Come Back Home,” BTS’ remake of Seo Taiji & Boys’ 1995 song of the same title, RM raps “hunnit band hunnit band hunnit band,” which means ‘$100,000, $100,000, $100,000.’ The same lyrics can be found in Childish Gambino’s “This is America,” which was 
 BTS’ favorites at the time of their Love Yourself: Tear US promotion.
 
(2) Although they are not really noticeable when listening, the lyrics have slight variations: bae (baby), bar (a sentence in lyrical hip hop songs or a slang for money/bill), bbae (business before anything else). 
똥 (poop; ddong), is actually a nickname for the November cards of Hwatu because they have 오동나무 (paulownia trees) on them and 동 (dong) becomes 똥 (ddong) when pronounced stiffly. November cards are considered desirable because there is one gwang card and also one regular card that gives you two points instead of one. 
‘The end’ should be spelled 끝 instead of 끗, which means points in gambling as explained above. The are pronounced the same, kkeut. 
Think about a quiz-show like setting. Ding-dong refers to the xylophone sound when the answer is correct, and ddaeng is the sound when the answer is wrong; “I’m correct, and you’re wrong.” 
The literal translation of this line is ‘you are 7-kkeut, I’m ddaeng.’ In 섰다, your cards make a 7-kkeut if the months add up to 7 (unit digit; 1+6, 3+4, 8+9, etc.), which is clearly much inferior to ddaeng. 
개얼탱 (pronounced as gae-ul-taeng) is a slang describing a situation where one finds something so ridiculous that s/he is at a loss for words. Notice how the above three lines end-rhyme with ‘ddaeng’ (by ending with thang, errthang, or ultaeng).  
(or, “we only excel, no break”) 
As explained in 항상 (HANGSANG), Frog in a well is a story about a frog that lived in a well, thinking that the small well is the entire world.","One-Eight One-Three Three-Eight ddaeng [5]

Pigeons that all jump up to when the wind blows

Favorable comments will make me humble 
When I get reviled,  
I will immediately digest the curses 
and shit them out

Everyone doesn’t make an effort to know J-Hope, and J-Hope becomes a watermelon, being judged by people with shallow understanding.

So 4 More,SoundCloud,6/13/2014,"Even when a year passes 
and even when another year comes, 
you and I will be walking on the same melody again 
Even when the night comes 
and even when it passes, 
our performance for a better life will continue 
I don’t wanna fuckin’ lie, I don’t do such thing 
My dam is above Seoul Tower, my mind is under the ground floor 
Having become a hostage to life, I chose to be ambitious 
To get lost and wander is my hobby, every day I feel clueless and overwhelmed 
Like monthly rents, my loneliness is overdue 
If you know the antonym of loneliness, lend me some 
There are many places where I belong 
But why is it that I can’t find the real me anywhere 
Who knows? You know? you don’t. I know I don’t 
It’s been already a year, but I can’t get used to it no matter how many time I try 
Every night, standing in front of a mirror and touching the side of my lips, I ask myself,   
“Are you really the Kim Namjoon that you’ve known?”
 
I should probably just lay it all down — 
all my agony, introspection, fear, and even the responsibility as a leader 
Things that I know so well but can never put down, 
the unavoidable friends of my life, you know what? 
Rap doesn’t have to be fast to be rap, and the same goes with life 
We all pour oil into water sometimes 
Wondering why the mountains that are my goals, success, and dreams, won’t get close to me, 
I was feeling impatient because the water won’t turn into fire even though I tried so hard  
Water and oil, they will never mix 
like you’ve seen in the science textbook 
It looked like it would never change, but now things have started 
Look at me who came to boil 
Soon I’ll become a fire 
and burn with flames 
Even when a year passes 
and even when another year comes, 
you and I will be walking on the same melody again 
Even when the night comes 
and even when it passes, 
our performance for a better life will continue 
A year without any space of comfort, I was walking on thin ice 
I don’t know where I’m going 
The conflict of my emotions 
Though my deep sigh now belongs to yesterday 
I still can’t sleep even at night 
A confusion that was expected 
Sleepless nights continue 
A prison that is envy, jealousy, and competition 
oppresses and suffocates me frequently 
My future is like an ink-wash painting
 
The two-letter word, success, that fills my mind 
Things I have to do and things and I want to do 
I’m Gulliver, standing in between the two 
Fuck it, I don’t give a shit 
Have I achieved my dream or lost my dream? 
I still don’t know, have I put off my dream of success? 
Behind the smile I put up like a fool, exactly a half of me is crying  
This is the evidence ofmy identity 
Reality and ideal, I get numb gradually and frustrated 
My sigh grows bigger from the thirst for and the conflicts about music 
Even when a year passes 
and even when another year comes, 
you and I will be walking on the same melody again 
Even when the night comes 
and even when it passes, 
our performance for a better life will continue 
The “time over” that I can feel — occupied with life, I didn’t realize 
The steps I took for one year 
I’m ill when the sun goes up, and, at night, I write lyrics again 
I live every day, my life is like a live performance, there is no lip-sync 
With this effort, I open the door of my beginning 
The more I sweat, the bigger my stage gets 
Cheers and applause, the support feels like a gift to me  
As more attention is drawn, my eyes already get teary 
Pressure and big worries accompany  
I feel burdened by the amount of love I received 
So, I’m nervous every day 
I have a good sense, but it’s not mature yet 
I try ironing myself, smoothing out my wrinkled mind, rewinding myself 
No matter how stormy it gets, Bangtan comforts me 
My steps will take me to success, wanna be now 
Yeah, I’m Sirius, shining brighter than all other stars 
At this moment, I’m still a ‘born singer,’ I hold my mic 
Even when a year passes 
and even when another year comes, 
you and I will be walking on the same melody again 
Even when the night comes 
and even when it passes, 
our performance for a better life will continue","Here, 밀리다 can describe something that is (1) overdue or (2) piled up. “Like how monthly rents get behind schedule, my loneliness has been piled up.”  
In “Life“, a year after the release of this song, RM still wonders why there is no antonym for loneliness. 
In “Intro: Persona,” 5 years after the release of this song, RM is still in search of himself.

Born Singer,SoundCloud,7/12/2013,"I’m a born singer, a bit belated confession  (I swear) 
A mirage that used to be ever so far away is in front of my eyes (It’s here) 
I’m a born singer, perhaps a bit early confession 
But, I’m so happy, I’m good 
The stage that I stepped onto in the name of Bangtan for the first time in my life 
I revisit how I felt three years ago on my very first stage 
I’m still not any different from a Daegu hillbilly rapper, but 
on the word ‘amateur’, I rewrote the word ‘pro’ 
Rapping and dancing on the stage where I’ve wanted to be so much, I feel that I’m still  alive 
Though coming to and from work is tiring and exhausting, I can bear it because my people are watching 
Though my body suffers from pain, I can stand it because cheers are coming in 
Though I live on the boundary between idol and rapper, the difference before and after debut, my note is still full of rhymes 
I hold my pen and write lyrics in between the waiting room and stage 
How have I, who’s like this, become any different to your eyes? 
Damn, shit, I’m still the same 
Did someone say I’ve changed? Go tell them

i dunno, that I and the world’s expectation are too asymmetric, 
I was scared that I might betray everyone who trusted me 
I stretch my burdened shoulders and step onto the very first stage 
A moment of silence, I collect my breath 
The people who I had been watching are now watching me 
The people on TV who I had always looked upon are now beneath me 
Without even a short moment to brush over the past, 
the one-time play began 
My blood and sweat of three years got evaporated in just three minutes 
The fierce tension between mic and me 
Though it was only tens of seconds,  
I poured myself clearly 
I’m fuckin real 
Dude, what is your dream,  
mine is to become a rap star 
Can’t you feel 
And the shouts at the moment I stepped down from the stage,  
Yeah I could read your mind, i could read your mind 
Just a gentle smile instead of a question mark, 
the members pat me on the shoulder without saying anything 
It just feels like the day before yesterday, but 20 nights have passed since then 
And let the haters hate on me 
the thing that they’ve been doing all the time 
While you were talking through your keyboard, I fulfilled my dreams

What would it be that I’m struggling to search for 
Where would it be that I’m unceasingly flowing towards 
I’ve seen the end of my life 
My heart felt suffocated 
What blocked me from living my life  
was my fear for tomorrow  
Angry Hungry Yes I’m hangry 
With every day repeating itself, talking about future was a nonsense 
I wasn’t there 
Even tomorrow wasn’t there either 
Because we’re still young, 
because there’s a decent future, 
hey, let’s now wipe away the cold tears, and 
COME BACK HOME 
Why would you waste your time 
My blood and sweats don’t lie 
Hey, let’s now engrave my name on that trophy, and  
COME BACK HOME 
YOU MUST COME BACK HOME 
Warmer than the heart that left away 
YOU MUST COME BACK HOME 
In this rough life 
YOU MUST COME BACK HOME 
Warmer than the heart that left away 
YOU MUST COME BACK HOME 
I’ll complete myself

What would it be that I’m struggling to search for 
Where would it be that I’m unceasingly flowing towards 
I’ve seen the end of my life 
My heart felt suffocated 
What blocked me from living my life  
was my fear for tomorrow  
Angry Hungry Yes I’m hangry 
With every day repeating itself, talking about future was a nonsense 
I wasn’t there 
Even tomorrow wasn’t there either 
Because we’re still young, 
because there’s a decent future,

Savage love 
Did somebody, did somebody 
Break your heart 
Lookin’ like an angel 
But you’re savage love 
When you kiss me 
I know you don’t give two fucks 
But I still want that 
If I woke up without you 
I don’t know what I would do 
Thought I could be single forever till I met you 
Usually don’t be fallin’, be fallin’, fallin’ first 
You gotta way of keeping me comin’ back to back 
I just found out the only reason that you lovin’ me 
Was to get back at your ex lover but before you leave 
Usually I would never, would never even care 
Baby I know she creepin’ I feel it in the air 
Every night and every day 
I try to make you stay

It all comes with conditions, “what do I love?” 
Perhaps the word forever is a sandcastle 
Even by gentle waves, it collapses helplessly 
Every night every day 
I’m swept away by the waves 
Don’t know what I’m thinking 
Can’t get you outta my head

Chicken noodle soup 
Chicken noodle soup 
Chicken noodle soup with a soda on the side  
From a you-know-what gang of Gwanggu 
Geumnam, Chungjang streets, those were my Harlem 
Joined Neuron, bounce with my team
 
Head over heels for dancing, I was a workaholic everyday 
A teen growing up being up all night every night, that’s my case 
My height is measured by dance, I’m okay 
A plan that pictures a great vision 
A kid who’s drawing his dream, steps that stomp over the rhythm 
Popping, rocking, hopping, tutting, dougie, flexing, swaggin’ 
I still do them every day hurriedly, for myself 
Always whipping myself, carrots on the trophies 
I bet on my life, dancing is my cash 
Hope on the street, now going on my way
 
With Becky G on the side 
Everyday I’m lit 
We always got love 
For where we come from 
So let ’em know what’s up 
No matter wherever we go

IU – eight (에잇) (Prod. & Feat. SUGA),Miscellaneous,5/6/2020,"So are you happy now 
Finally happy now are you 
Well, I’m still the same 
It feels like I’ve lost it all 
Everything comes to me as it pleases and leaves without even saying goodbye 
If it’s like this, I don’t want to love anything 
I travel through the memories that are as worn out and frayed as they can be
 
We, under the orange sun, 
without shadows, dance together 
There is no such thing like a set goodbye 
We’ll see each other in those beautiful memories 
Forever young 
Woowoowoo woowoowoowoo woowoowoo woowoowoowoo 
Forever we young 
Woowoowoo woowoowoowoo 
If it’s a nightmare like this, I will never wake up from it 
Island, yeah, an island 
A small island that we both built 
Yeah, um, forever young 
The word forever is a sandcastle 
A goodbye is like a disaster text alert 
The morning I greet with the feeling of longing 
After we each pass this eternity, 
let us meet on this island 
Unlike the passing words of comforting, 
it’s not so easy to forget just a handspan-sized piece of memory 
Even when the time passes, still, 
I continue to be where it holds me 
We, under the orange sun, 
without shadows, dance together 
There is no such thing like a set goodbye 
We’ll see each other in those beautiful memories 
Forever young 
We pillow our heads on each other 
and share stories that are not sad 
There is no such thing like a blue ending 
I’ll forever see you in these memories 
Forever young 
Woowoowoo woowoowoowoo woowoowoo woowoowoowoo 
Forever we young 
Woowoowoo woowoowoowoo 
If it’s a nightmare like this, I will never wake up from it","Note: 해지다 (shortened version of 해어지다: to wear out, to fray) can also be decomposed as 해 + 지다 where 해 means the sun and 지다 is to set (to go down). It makes a clever bridge to the next verse that starts with “the orange sun,” preparing the canvas to be colored in sunset orange.

 [manna]","So are you happy now 
Finally happy now are you 
Well, I’m still the same 
It feels like I’ve lost it all 
Everything comes to me as it pleases and leaves without even saying goodbye 
If it’s like this, I don’t want to love anything 
I travel through the memories that are as worn out and frayed as they can be
 
We, under the orange sun, 
without shadows, dance together 
There is no such thing like a set goodbye 
We’ll see each other in those beautiful memories 
Forever young 
Woowoowoo woowoowoowoo woowoowoo woowoowoowoo 
 
Woowoowoo woowoowoowoo 
If it’s a nightmare like this, I will never wake up from it 
Island, yeah, an island 
A small island that we both built 
Yeah, um,  
The word forever is a sandcastle 
A goodbye is like a disaster text alert 
The morning I greet with the feeling of longing 
After we each pass this eternity, 
let us meet on this island 
Unlike the passing words of comforting, 
it’s not so easy to forget just a handspan-sized piece of memory 
Even when the time passes, still, 
I continue to be where it holds me 
We, under the orange sun, 
without shadows, dance together 
There is no such thing like a set goodbye 
We’ll see each other in those beautiful memories 
Forever young 
We pillow our heads on each other 
and share stories that are not sad 
There is no such thing like a blue ending 
I’ll forever see you in these memories 
Forever young 
Woowoowoo woowoowoowoo woowoowoo woowoowoowoo 
 
Woowoowoo woowoowoowoo 
If it’s a nightmare like this, I will never wake up from it","So are you happy now 
Finally happy now are you 
Forever young 
Forever we young 
forever young 
Forever young 
Forever young 
Forever we young",[],https://doolsetbangtan.wordpress.com/2020/05/06/iu-eight-prod-feat-suga/,,,0
YOUNHA – WINTER FLOWER (Feat. RM),Miscellaneous,2/25/2020,"In the chilling winter wind, under the deep footprints, I bloom alone 
and wander, searching for the reasons why I was born and why I met you 
The sigh that scatters, white, is my tears, frozen 
The abandoned dreams bear another scar 
Where would the end of this season be 
If there is an eternity, 
Hold on hold on hold on 
I will take it away before you stumble 
I will stay by your side until you survive, 
hoping you would bloom 
Why is it that I met you — 
of all days and all places, right now, right here, on this winter day, 
when spring feels far away when I close my eyes 
and where it’s full of cold breaths 
I was born red, from the blood you shed in the harsh winter 
Plum blossom in the snow, camelia, daffodil 
Yeah, I’m okay with whatever you call me 
They say life is full of paradox 
All you gotta do is gettin’ used to this marathon 
Would it be that the world is cruel only to you? 
‘It is hard for anyone’ 
To you, who has become an adult, such words cannot be a consolation 
Listen well, winter 
It is you who bloomed me 
Now, with my branches, I will emanate a blue scent 
I will let you know  
that there is another sky 
With all my strength, I will call it in — 
the autumn that resembled you 
The light that scatters, white, is the sun, frozen 
Even if it still exists, like the covered moon 
Where would the end of this waiting be 
If there is a beginning, 
Hold on hold on hold on 
I will take it away before you stumble 
I will stay by your side until you survive, 
hoping you would bloom 
I will not forget your warmth 
I will be a flower of the winter, a dancing star, and 
I will be by your side 
I’m with you 
I will take it away before you stumble 
I will stay by your side until you survive 
I hope you bloom 
I hope you bloom 
I hope you bloom 
I hope you bloom 
I hope you bloom","설중매 (雪中梅), which is the subtitle of WINTER FLOWER, means plum blossoms in the snow. 동백 (冬柏, where 冬 means winter; camilia) blooms in winter, between January and March. 수선화 (水仙花; daffodil) also has a high tolerance to cold and bloom between December and March. 수선화 is also called 설중화 (雪中花, flower in the snow).
The three flowers, which bloom despite the harsh weather or after enduring a long winter, all represent noble minds, strong spirits, and pure heart.

Halsey – SUGA’s Interlude,Miscellaneous,12/5/2019,"I’ve been trying all my life 
To separate the time 
In between the having it all 
And giving it up, yeah 
Ey, in my head, these wanderings that are only full of blue 
In my mind, living are the self-loathing and excessive pride 
I, full of dreams, grew up to have all my dreams realized but,  
at the same time, am living with a thought that dreams are better when kept as dreams 
That my leap would not be my fall, 
that your convictions, efforts, beliefs, and greeds are not ugly nor dirty, 
I believe, ey 
Though the dawn right before the sunrise is darker than anything,  
never forget that the stars you longed for only rise in the darkness 
I’ve been trying all my life 
To separate the time 
In between the having it all 
And giving it up, yeah 
I wonder what’s in store 
If I don’t love it anymore  
Stuck between the having it all 
And giving it up, yeah 
Sometimes I wonder if I’m walking on the right path,  
what else will be there if I run unceasingly towards the end of the tunnel,  
and if it is right to do so in the first place 
Honestly, it’s different from the future I hoped for, 
but that doesn’t matter

BTS – Heartbeat (BTS WORLD OST),Miscellaneous,6/28/2019,"It leaves me feeling seasick baby 
It feels like I’m trapped in a dream-like reality 
It spins me round and drives me crazy 
I must be like a moon hanging in the sky at midday 
If I had been alone, if I had not known you 
I might have given up, lost at sea 
But my heart’s still on fire with a burning desire 
I’ll find you again, like fate 
I wish that you would love me 
Don’t ever let go of this hand like yesterday 
And every time my heart beats, 
step to my heartbeat so you never get lost and wander again 
I feel the fate, you, you 
I feel the fate, me, me 
When you hear my heartbeat baby
 
You gave me a new life you gave me a new birth
 
I feel you’re heartbeat away 
I been losin my mind I been cravin my shine
 
I know me before you was a ready-made me
 
But you designate me and you did resume me
 
Been calling your name in this whole universe
 
(Now I need no space) I got youniverse 
Meeting you feels like an episode of a drama crafted by the universe 
Countless wanderings
Being lost, unable to see the end 
You, who led me through that maze 
You are my light, my savior
