<h3>Safety vs. discomfort</h3>
<p>
While the available data supports that the 16 Turk Street residence hall is
substantially more dangerous than other locations, student perceptions of the
source of this danger and their personal risk can be shaped by stereotypes —
specifically, anti-Black racism and stigma against homeless people. Many
hallmarks of poverty and discrimination in the Tenderloin neighborhood, like
young men playing loud rap music on the corner or people sleeping on the street,
might threaten students’ comfort more than their safety.
</p>
<ul>
<li>There are students who mentioned this issue in their survey responses so
will interview them and include here
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Several responses to Quest’s survey, for example, identified the presence of
homeless or “sketch” people and open drug use as reasons the student felt
uncomfortable around 16 Turk Street and, to a lesser extent, 1412 Market Street.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Conduct more research on actual risk from homeless people and drug use
</li>
</ul>
<p>
It’s also important to keep in mind that many of the marginalized populations
some students fear are themselves more at risk of both crime and being
victimized by the police.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Again, cite studies about police brutality and criminalization of
homelessness
</li>
