    <h1>How (un)safe is 16 Turk Street? Analyzing reports of crime and harassment
    around Minerva’s San Francisco residence hall </h1>

<div id=’introduction’ class='text'>
    <p>
    In 2019, Minerva began using 16 Turk Street as its main San Francisco residence
    hall. The building’s location on the edge of San Francisco’s Tenderloin
    neighborhood has consistently spurred concern about the risks students face when
    they venture outside. Prior to 2019, students were housed at two other
    locations: 1412 Market Street and 851 California Street.
    </p>
    <p>
    Of the 59 Minerva students who responded to a Quest survey, 26 (44%) said 16
    Turk was the least safe residence hall they’d lived in. Some students have tried
    to avoid living at 16 Turk Street and question why Minerva administrators would
    house students in the area at all. In light of these ongoing conversations, the
    Quest investigated the threat of crime around 16 Turk in comparison to the two
    other residence halls Minerva has used in San Francisco.
    </p>
    <p>
    The Quest’s investigation revealed that the area surrounding 16 Turk is
    significantly less safe compared to previous Minerva residence halls in almost
    every way. More incidents are reported near the building and a greater
    proportion of the crimes reported are violent. Minerva students report
    experiencing crime and harassment more often when living at 16 Turk, and most
    students feel unsafe going about their daily lives in the area.
    </p>
    <p>
    This might seem like a foregone conclusion to anyone familiar with the area
    around 16 Turk. As someone who’s lived in 16 Turk since Fall 2020, I certainly
    wasn’t shocked by most of the statistics this piece includes.
    </p>
    <p>
    But it’s important to understand the extent to which verifiable risk and
    experience of crime overlap with perceptions of safety. It’s also important to
    quantitatively compare 16 Turk to the other residence halls Minerva has used.
    That’s what this article does — keep reading to learn more.
    </p>
    <p>
    This data journalism article is the first in a two-part series on this subject.
    The second article will explore how the student community and Minerva
    administrators have responded to the safety risks discussed below.
    </p>
</div>
<div id=’crime_general’ class='text'>
    <h2>More crime is reported around 16 Turk in general</h2>
    <p>
    According to <a
    href="https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-2018-to-Present/wg3w-h783">San
    Francisco Police Department incident report data</a>, an average of
    approximately 15.9 incidents per day were reported within a 300 meter radius of
    16 Turk in 2019. The data reflects incident reports, not just confirmed crimes,
    and includes reports of non-criminal emergencies like overdoses as well as
    non-criminal violations of the law like traffic infractions. Coordinates for
    each incident report are mapped to the nearest road intersection, rather than
    the precise location of the incident. Scroll down to <a href="#’methodology’">the
    Methodology section</a> for more details on what specifically this data
    includes.
    </p>
    <p>
    <div id='total_map' class='viz map'></div>
    </p>
    <p>
    <em>The above map displays the total incidents reported near each San Francisco
    intersection in 2019. The larger and darker the circle over an intersection is,
    the more incidents were reported near there. Click on an intersection to see
    exactly how many incidents were reported near there in 2019. </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    <b>The amount of incidents reported within a 300 meter radius of 16 Turk is over
    three times higher than the rates for both the residence halls Minerva has used
    in the past</b>: 851 California Street (approximately 3 incidents/day) and 1412
    Market Street (approximately 4 incidents/day).
    </p>
    <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart viz"
    data-src="visualisation/5620408"><script
    src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
    <p>
    What might surprise students is that incident report rates around 1412 Market
    are closer to that of 851 California than 16 Turk Street. This may seem
    counterintuitive because 1412 Market and 16 Turk Street are both located in the
    Tenderloin neighborhood — which might suggest similar crime rates — whereas 851
    California is in the elevated Nob Hill neighborhood where one might expect low
    incidence of crime.
    </p>
    <p>
    The data examined here can’t explain why so many more incidents are reported
    near 16 Turk compared to 1412 Market Street. It may be the case that the
    underlying risk of crime is similar in both locations, but 16 Turk is in a
    busier area and therefore has more incidents. It may also be the case that 16
    Turk is actually significantly riskier. More likely, a combination of these
    reasons contributes to the differing outcomes in these two locations.
    </p>
</div>
<div id=’violent_crime’ class='text'>
    <h2>Crime around 16 Turk is more likely to be violent</h2>
    <p>
    In addition to having higher general crime rates, the area around 16 Turk Street
    also has more reported incidents of <a
    href="https://nij.ojp.gov/topics/crimes/violent-crime">violent crime</a> —
    defined here as assault, robbery, homicide, rape, and sex offenses.
    </p>
    <div id='violent_map' class='viz map'></div>
    <p>
    <em>The above map displays the violent crimes reported near each San Francisco
    intersection in 2019. I defined violent crime as assault, robbery, homicide,
    rape, and sex offenses. The larger and darker the circle over an intersection
    is, the more violent crimes were reported near it. Click on an intersection to
    see exactly how many violent crimes were reported near there in 2019. </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    As the chart below shows, 16 Turk Street has especially high rates of assault —
    the second most common crime in the area. <b>On average, almost two assaults (1.88
    assault reports/day) are reported within a 300 meter radius of 16 Turk street
    each day. The rate of assault near 16 Turk is over six times the amount reported
    near 1412 Market Street (0.28 assault reports/day) and 851 California Street
    (0.12 assault reports/day).</b> For students who live in 16 Turk and are used to
    hearing street fights and the occasional gunshot from our rooms, this is hardly
    surprising. The most common crime near each residence hall is theft.
    </p>

    <h2>Minerva students experience more crime around 16 Turk</h2>
    <p>
    The relative crime rates around each residence hall align with most students’
    perceptions of safety  — 16 Turk Street is more dangerous than 1412 Market
    Street, which is more dangerous than 851 California Street.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
    Experience with crime reported by Minerva students on the Quest’s survey broadly
    reflect the general trends discussed above, though the sample size of 59
    respondents does not fully account for student experiences. <b>16 students told the
    Quest that they had been a victim of a crime in or near a Minerva residence
    hall. A majority of those students (9) reported that the crime occurred near 16
    Turk Street.</b> Consistent with general crime statistics, 1412 Market Street had
    the second highest number of crimes (5) reported near it. The crimes that
    students described included assault and threats of violence, theft, sexual
    harassment, and rape.
    </p>
    <p>
    <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart"
    data-src="visualisation/6018714"><script
    src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
    </p>
    <p>
    Minerva has <a
    href="https://minervaschools.wufoo.com/forms/z12pw7gl1ukb8nr/">its own reporting
    forms</a> students can use to report safety incidents and, as a branch campus of
    Keck Graduate Institute, is legally required to publish crime data based on
    these forms and police calls for service in an <a
    href="https://minervaschools-production-cms-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/Annual_Security_Report_2019_-_2020_1.pdf">Annual
    Fire Safety and Security Report</a>. Minerva’s data, however, show less
    incidents than have been reflected in Quest’s survey.
    </p>
    <p>
    <b>The true rate at which Minerva students are the victims of crimes and street
    harassment is difficult to quantify.</b> The Quest survey obviously doesn’t include
    the experiences of all students because not all students responded. It’s
    possible students were more likely to respond if they’d had problems on the
    street, which may mean that the prevalence of crimes committed against students
    is somewhat exaggerated here.
    </p>
    <p>
    Presented with Quest’s findings, Kayla Krupnick Walsh, Minerva’s Dean of
    Students, and Jason Lindo, Minerva’s San Francisco Director of Student Life &
    Operations, wrote that “The numbers that are quoted in your report do not match
    the numbers of reports that have been made to staff and therefore we once again
    encourage students who are the victims of crimes or concerned they may have been
    the victim of a crime to speak with their Community Manager or City Director as
    soon as possible so that we may support them and work toward longer term
    resolutions.”
    </p>
    <p>
    Several Minerva students told the Quest they haven’t reported incidents to
    Minerva because they didn’t think it would be worth the effort. One anonymous
    M’22 student described four separate incidents of assault and harassment in
    downtown San Francisco. She concluded her response by writing “None of these
    incidences were ever reported to Minerva building staff because I did not see
    what use they could be [and] found [it] to be a waste of time [and] effort [and]
    emotional expenditure on my part.”
    </p>
    <p>
    How students respond to crime and the ways Minerva has and has not supported
    them will be further discussed in the next article in this series. For the
    purposes of this data-driven report, I simply want to emphasize how difficult it
    is to comprehensively quantify a topic as sensitive and complex as crime and
    harassment.
    </p>

    </p>
</div>
<div id=’street_harassment’ class='text'>
    <h2>Street Harassment is an especially hard to quantify but pervasive
    problem</h2>
    <p>
    Street harassment is even more difficult to understand through data. The
    incident report data explored in the maps and charts above don't fully reflect
    catcalling and other types of sexual harassment. While <a
    href="https://stopstreetharassment.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SSH-KYR-California.pdf">some
    of these offenses are illegal under California law</a>, they tend to go
    unreported. But this type of harassment significantly influences how safe
    students, especially women and female-presenting students, feel in a
    neighborhood.
    </p>
    <p>
    “What usually makes me feel safest is how often female members of the community
    experience altercations,” Ri Bouthiller, an M’20 alum who is nonbinary yet often
    perceived as a woman, told the Quest. “People got robbed at knifepoint in Buenos
    Aires, but I didn't feel unsafe because no locals were harassing me.”
    </p>
    <p>
    The issue of catcalling underscores how gendered experiences of safety are.
    Male-presenting students are generally more likely to say that they feel safe in
    a neighborhood and less likely to experience harassment and crime.
    Female-presenting students are more likely to feel unsafe in a neighborhood
    because of harassment, and many plan their daily routines to avoid times and
    locations they deem risky. These students are also more likely to be the victim
    of a crime or harassment, as the chart below shows.
    </p>
    <p>
    <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart"
    data-src="visualisation/6018779"><script
    src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
    </p>
    <p>
    Though mentioned less frequently in survey responses and interviews, students
    also face racist and homophobic street harassment. Peleg Shilo, a male M’23
    student, told the Quest that he was called anti-gay slurs by an assailant in
    downtown San Francisco. He also noted that “I am not gay, nor do I believe I
    ‘look gay’.”
    </p>
    <p>
    Over the past year, Asian and Asian-presenting students have increasingly faced
    harassment and threats <a
    href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-03-16/anti-asian-hate-pandemic">due
    in part to racist rhetoric about the coronavirus pandemic exacerbating
    prejudice</a>. Nathan Torento, an M’21 student from the Philippines, said that
    street harassers have called him anti-Asian and anti-Chinese slurs and
    threatened to kill him on multiple occasions in downtown San Francisco.
    </p>
    <p>
    It didn’t matter to harassers that Bouthiller is nonbinary, Shilo is not gay,
    and Torento is Filipino, not Chinese. Obviously, someone who chooses to yell
    slurs and threats at strangers isn’t going to correctly grasp that
    person’s identity. Yet the discrepancy is worth emphasizing because while many
    students are aware of how they are perceived (correctly or not) by others, some
    may be the targets of harassment they don’t expect.
    </p>
    <p>
    While street harassment can significantly impact a students’ experience in a
    city, many students don’t report these incidents to Minerva or the police. A few
    respondents to the Quest’s anonymous survey struggled with whether to define
    sexual harassment, like catcalling and being followed, as crimes. Some students
    complained about repeated harassment but concluded it was not a crime, while a
    few reported these as crimes.
    </p>
    <p>
</div>
<div id=’crime_context’ class='text'>
    </p>
    <h2>Why are crime and harassment more common near 16 Turk?</h2>
    <p>
    The data explored above establish that the general public and Minerva students
    are more likely to report problems in the area surrounding 16 Turk Street. Yet
    my analysis hasn't delved into the complex factors that can help explain why the
    Tenderloin and the streets close to 16 Turk have elevated crime rates.
    </p>
    <p>
    The first possible explanation given by many Minerva students and the
    administrators who responded to Quest’s questions for this article is
    “homelessness.” In my conversations with Minerva community members for this
    article and as a student in general, I’ve noticed that homelessness and crime
    risk are often used interchangeably.
    </p>
    <p>
    Carelessly associating homelessness with crime can further stigmatize this
    marginalized group. A few students who responded to Quest’s survey expressed
    concern that discussions of crime around San Francisco residence halls can
    become racist against the Tenderloin’s many Black residents and worsen stigma
    against homeless people. I share their concerns, so I want to openly address the
    issue here.
    </p>
    <p>
    The crimes Minerva students described to the Quest provide anecdotal evidence
    that many incidents do involve individuals who appear homeless. It’s not hard to
    imagine why someone experiencing extreme poverty might be more likely to steal
    or why someone with an untreated mental illness might behave unpredictably and
    sometimes violently.
    </p>
    <p>
    Yet many conversations amongst housed people neglect to address how <a
    href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24672998/">frequently homeless people
    experience violent crime</a> themselves. Implying that all homeless people are
    also criminals only reinforces efforts to criminalize homelessness and to <a
    href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/We-don-t-want-to-be-outside-Homeless-say-14882625.php">move
    those living on the street out of sight without providing adequate services</a>.
    A similar knee-jerk reaction to valid safety concerns is increasing police
    presence in the area, which <a
    href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/7/7/21293259/police-racism-violence-ideology-george-floyd">disproportionately
    harms Black residents</a> without addressing the deeper issues that imperil all
    community members.
    </p>
    <p>
    Many within the Minerva community will go out of their way to mention some of
    the broader societal forces behind homelessness and crime. In their response to
    the Quest, Krupnick Walsh and Lindo noted that “the impacts of the lack of an
    effective American social safety net and the systemic racism in America are
    evidenced on the streets of San Francisco.” Bouthiller told the Quest that while
    signs of poverty and desperation in an area make her feel less safe there, “it's
    not that I’m scared of homeless people, but homeless people are normally a
    symptom of a greater problem in the area that makes me feel like I shouldn’t
    trust police in that place.”
    </p>
    <p>
    The next article in this series will further discuss how the Minerva community
    has responded to safety risks in San Francisco and what we could do better. I
    want to conclude this piece, however, by emphasizing that the data and student
    stories discussed here are the result of a societal failure to keep everyone,
    including and especially homeless people, safe.
    </p>
</div>
<div id=’methodology’ class='text'>
    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <p>
    General data about incident reports that have been filed with the San Francisco
    Police Department are <a
    href="https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-2018-to-Present/wg3w-h783">available
    here</a>. The code used to analyze this data is <a
    href="https://github.com/emmastiefel/sf-res-crime-analysis">available here</a>.
    This data consists of <a
    href="https://support.datasf.org/help/police-department-incident-reports-2018-to-present-overview">incident
    reports made by members of the public and police officers</a> and includes
    reported non-criminal offenses.
    </p>
    <p>
    The anonymous Quest survey used to collect student experiences with safety and
    crime is <a href="https://forms.gle/XCfvYAra9atDN6og7">available here</a>; the
    fully anonymized dataset is <a
    href="https://github.com/the-minerva-quest/minerva-open-data/tree/main/City%20Data/Crime%20and%20Safety%20Data">available
    here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    Precise location data about reported crimes and incidents was generally not
    available. The San Francisco incident report data provides the nearest
    intersection rather than the specific location where a report was made. Students
    sometimes provided specific locations in their survey responses but mostly
    referenced a general area. Some instances of crime and harassment, such as a
    perpetrator following a student to a residence hall, couldn’t be easily mapped
    to a single location even if the data were available.
    </p>
    <p>
    For the San Francisco incident report data, an intersection was defined as being
    ‘near’ a residence hall if the distance between it and the residence was less
    than a defined radius, based on latitude and longitude coordinates. The full
    code is available in the file linked above. I tested four different radii for
    defining proximity, and the average per-residence hall daily crime rates for
    each are included in the “Average daily incident reports near San Francisco
    residence halls” chart.
    </p>
    <p>
    Defining proximity using a fixed radius from a residence hall doesn’t fully
    reflect how students navigate and experience an area. The radius may include
    locations many students avoid — while living in 16 Turk Street, for example, I
    have never visited the intersections of Turk and Taylor Street or Eddy and
    Taylor Street because I don’t feel safe there, even though they are on the same
    block as the residence hall.
    </p>
    <p>
    I only used public incident report data from 2019 because of how the coronavirus
    pandemic impacted trends. Daily incident reports dropped sharply after the onset
    of the pandemic and implementation of public health measures in early 2020. I
    filtered out pandemic-era data because I want this analysis to generalize to the
    long-term future, during which incident report rates will presumably return to
    pre-pandemic levels.
