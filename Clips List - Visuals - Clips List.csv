It presents information about student visa fees Minerva students must pay in order to complete the global rotation, our school’s study-abroad model that sends students to San Francisco, Seoul, Hyderabad, Berlin, Buenos Aires, London, and finally Taipei.

I used D3.js to build the interactive bar chart and implement scrollytelling features. The student visa fees data I collected, as well as the code I used to scrape F-1 visa information from the US Department of State website, is linked to in the “Data Sources” section of the piece. I also wrote a short python script to clean some of the data and used my own dataset matching script to merge multiple data sources into one csv file.

This piece is my first published interactive data visualization and, while it’s not perfect, completing it taught me how to iteratively improve my work by incorporating feedback from multiple sources and expanding my knowledge of Javascript and HTML/CSS as needed.","D3.js, data integration, data verification, Python/Pandas, web scraping, Python/Beautiful Soup, fuzzy matching, interviewing, scrollytelling",1,10/16/2020,The Minerva Quest,Student Journalism,1,1,1,Sole creator
