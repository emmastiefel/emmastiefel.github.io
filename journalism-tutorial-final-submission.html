            <h2>Understanding Minerva Student Visa Fees</h2>
                <p>
                By Emma Stiefel for <a href="https://www.minervaquest.com/">the Minerva Quest</a> 
                </p>
                <p>
                All Minerva students have to pay student visa fees in order to complete the global rotation, but the total amount varies significantly depending on nationality. Some rotation countries raise fees for specific nationalities, increasing costs. On the other hand, if a student is a citizen of a rotation country, they save money by not having to apply for a visa. This interactive chart shows how rotation country visa fees for Minerva students add up over the course of the four year program.
                </p>
            <h3>Instructions and Disclaimers</h3>
                <p>
                For the best experience, please view this interactive data visualization on a laptop, not a mobile device. Hover over a bar to view detailed information about it.
                </p>
                <p>
                This chart only shows student visa fee information for nationalities that are currently represented at Minerva. This data is sourced from the most up-to-date government and Minerva documents and is intended to show visa fees for the 2021-2022 academic year. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Visa fees and exchange rates are subject to change, so the information shown here is an approximation, not exact prediction, of costs. Moreover, the data shown here does not account for indirect visa application costs, like shipping documents, which make the process more expensive.
                </p>
        </section>
        <section class="data-step">
            <h3>US F-1</h3>
            <p>
            Most students must apply for a US F-1 visa in order to enter San Francisco for their first year at Minerva. The basic F-1 visa costs consist of a <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/fees/fees-visa-services.html">$160 application fee</a> and a <a href="https://www.ice.gov/sevis/i901">$350 SEVIS (Student and Exchange Visitor Information System) fee</a>, which funds the centralized collection of data about nonimmigrant students in the US. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Other costs, like shipping documents and transportation for interviews, can make applying for an F-1 visa even more expensive for some students. These costs, as well as SEVIS and reciprocity fees, aren’t always communicated clearly to students. “[Paying for student visa fees is] a game changer,” a Kenyan student wrote in Quest’s anonymous survey. “Imagine having to pay over $700 up front yet people only talk about $160.”
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="data-step">
            <h3>US F-1 Reciprocity Fees</h3>
                <p>
                In addition to the F-1 visa application fee and SEVIS fee, some students must also pay an F-1 reciprocity fee. According to <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/Visa-Reciprocity-and-Civil-Documents-by-Country.html">the US Department of State</a>, “when a foreign government imposes fees on U.S. citizens for certain types of visas, the United States will impose a reciprocal fee on citizens of that country for similar types of visas.” 
                </p>
                <p>
                Of the nationalities currently represented at Minerva, 13 must pay F-1 reciprocity fees. The median reciprocity fee for Minerva students who have to pay it is $220. 
                </p>
        </section>
        <section class="data-step">
            <h3>South Korea</h3>
                <p>
                Most Minerva students pay a flat rate of $60 for the South Korean visa required to study in Seoul. Several nationalities are exempt from fees. Others pay higher fees — for UK citizens, the cost is $200. 
                </p>
                <p>
                South Korea is one of several rotation countries that require students to submit proof that they can afford to support themselves for the semester. According to <a href="https://hub.minerva.kgi.edu/cities/seoul/legal-financial-info-seoul/visa-seoul/">the Hub (link accessible with minerva.kgi.edu email)</a>, students can submit documents from their personal bank account, their parents’ bank account, or their work-study award. 
                </p>
                <p>
                For some students, required minimum bank balances are a significant obstacle to securing a visa. An anonymous student from a developing country in Asia told the Quest that bank balance requirements prevented her from joining her classmates in Argentina — she was required to have $2,000 in savings, but barely had $1,000. Instead of travelling to Buenos Aires, she had to move in with family members in San Francisco.  
                </p>
        </section>
        <section class="data-step">
            <h3>India</h3>
                <p>
                For the Hyderabad semester, most Minerva students pay about $90 to receive their Indian student visa while studying in Seoul. The fees range from a low of about $15 for Pakistanis to over $250 for Nigerians. That cost includes both the standard application fee as well as the approximately $5 passport delivery fee. 
                </p>
                <p>
                The Indian student visa fees illustrate that the cost of applying doesn’t necessarily correspond with a student’s likelihood of receiving a visa. Despite paying comparatively low fees to submit an application, most if not all Pakistani students have been prohibited from joining their peers in Hyderabad. Conversely, UK citizens pay higher fees for South Korean and Indian visas but have <a href="https://www.henleypassportindex.com/passport">strong passports</a> and are generally successful applicants. Nigerian citizens pay higher fees to study in the US and India but have <a href="https://www.henleypassportindex.com/passport">weak passports</a> and are sometimes denied visas. 
                </p>
        </section>
        <section class="data-step">
            <h3>Germany </h3>
                <p>
                Most Minerva students pay a fee of about $90 to apply for a visa to study in Berlin. Citizens of European Economic Area countries do not require a visa. 
                </p>
                <p>
                In some cases, a student’s initial application for a visa is rejected - something that can happen for any rotation country, not just Germany. If the student decides to re-apply, they typically must pay all required fees again. This happened to one Pakistani student who responded to the Quest’s anonymous survey. “It’s tough and adds to the financial strain,” they wrote. “Minerva doesn't have a good system for appropriate visa guidance, which leads to us low-income students suffering even more.”
                </p>
                <p>
                Minerva does have a team, led by Student Services Global Director Marianna Panossi, which assists students with securing visas. It is difficult to fully account for the intricacies of global travel regulations, however, and some students have to figure out the details of the application processes on their own.

        <section class="data-step">
            <h3>Argentina</h3>
                <p>
                All students, with the exception of Argentine nationals, pay an approximately $180 fee to apply for an Argentine student visa while studying in Berlin. 
                </p>
                <p>
                One component of the Argentine visa application is photos, which many students take in Berlin. Most students also have to take photos in Seoul as part of their Indian visa application and must take photos over the summer while applying for some other rotation country visas. While the exact cost of taking and printing these pictures varies significantly with location, it is an example of an indirect cost which is burdensome for some students.
                </p>

        <section class="data-step">
            <h3>UK</h3>
                <p>
                Except for UK citizens, all students pay an approximately $120 student visa fee to study in London. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Prior to the 2021 academic year, citizens of European Economic Area countries did not require a visa to study in London because the UK was still part of the European Union. After <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/new-immigration-system-what-you-need-to-know">Brexit is finalized</a> at the end of this year, however, students from these countries will have to apply for UK student visas. Those costs are reflected in this chart.

        <section class="data-step">
            <h3>Taiwan</h3>
                <p>
                All Minerva students, except for Taiwanese citizens, pay $50 for a single-entry visitor visa that allows them to study in Taipei during their final semester. 
                </p>
        </section>
        <section class="data-step">
            <h3>US F-1 Reapplication</h3>
                <p>
                All Minerva students are required to return to San Francisco for one month at the end of their studies. Many students can enter the US on the same F-1 visa they received for their first year, but for some nationalities the F-1 visa expires before the fourth year. These students must re-apply for an F-1 visa before graduating in San Francisco, which requires paying the $160 application fee again (students do not need to repay the $350 SEVIS fee). 
                </p>
                <p>
                Students whose F-1 visas are valid for shorter periods may also need to re-apply if they choose to return to the US before their fourth year, such as for internships or research programs. Vietnamese and Russian students, for example, receive F-1 visas that are only valid for 12 months and must re-apply every year they want to re-enter the US.
                </p>
        </section>
        <section class="data-step">
            <h3>US F-1 Reapplication Reciprocity Fees</h3>
                <p>
                When applicable, students must also pay the reciprocity fee again if they re-apply for an F-1 visa. Currently, the only nationalities represented at Minerva that must pay a reciprocity fee and re-apply for an F-1 visa are Nigeria and Thailand. 
                </p>
        </section>
        <section class="step">
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                Student visa costs are significant for most students — the median total cost is approximately $1,100. Depending on their nationality, students may pay anywhere from half to twice this amount. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Most students, however, are not fully aware of these fees when they enroll. Out of 12 students who responded to an anonymous Quest survey, five said they either did not expect to pay for student visa fees or did not have any estimated amount in mind when they enrolled. Eight of the respondents reported paying more for student visa fees than they anticipated. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Minerva’s public-facing <a href="https://www.minerva.kgi.edu/tuition-aid/tuition-fees/">Tuition & Fees page</a> does not explicitly mention student visa fees. Once students enroll, they can access student visa fee information on <a href="https://hub.minerva.kgi.edu/resources/student-finances-and-financial-aid/visa-fees/">the Hub (link accessible with minerva.kgi.edu email)</a>. Currently, however, this page contains out-of-date links for Indian and South Korean visas, provides no fee information for Argentine visas, and does not include re-application and reciprocity fees for US F-1 visas. Visa information on country-specific Hub pages may be more up-to-date, and Minerva typically communicates fee information to students once they are actively applying for a visa. 
                </p>
                <p>
                But there is no central source of accurate information for students hoping to proactively account for all student visa costs in their financial plans. For many students, especially those from low-income backgrounds, access to financial information about visa fees and other mandatory expenses is essential for ensuring they can afford a Minerva education. As the previously mentioned anonymous Kenyan student wrote, “I think the list of potential fees should be as thorough as possible, and it should be communicated as soon as we receive our financial aid offer.”
