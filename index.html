            Hi, I’m Emma Stiefel. 
            </h1>
            <p>
            I use data, design, and storytelling to explain complex systems with an emphasis on what we don’t know about a topic as well as what we do. I strive to meet my audience where they’re at in terms of data literacy and background knowledge and make sure that my work serves the information needs of a community. 
            </p>
