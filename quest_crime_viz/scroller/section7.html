<h3>Where do Minerva students say they feel safe?</h3>
<p>
The short answer to this question is: Seoul. Of the 45 students who both
responded to the Questâ€™s survey and spent a semester in South Korea, 37 said
that the Seoul residence was where they felt the safest. Most students who
responded to the survey had lived in the Yongsan neighborhood residence, which
Minerva has used to house students from the class of 2021 on, but the same trend
applied to the Gangnam neighborhood residence as well.

Reasons given for feeling safe in Seoul include the prevalence of CCTV cameras
and a lack of street harassment.
