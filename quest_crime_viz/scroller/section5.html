<h3>Catcalling and sexual harassment</h3>
<p>
The crime data explored above doesn’t reflect catcalling and some other types of
sexual harassment because they aren’t defined as crimes or tend to go
unreported. The frequency of this type of harassment, however, significantly
influences how safe students, especially female and nonbinary students, feel in
a neighborhood.

The issue of catcalling underscores how gendered experiences of safety are. Male
students are generally more likely to say that they feel safe in a neighborhood
— almost of the students who reported feeling safe around 16 Turk in Quest’s
survey were men. Female and nonbinary students are more likely to feel unsafe in
a neighborhood because of harassment, and many shape their daily routines to
avoid times and locations they deem risky. These students are also much more
likely to be the victim of a crime or harassment, as the chart below shows.
