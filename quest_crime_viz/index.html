        <h1>How (un)safe is 16 Turk Street? Analyzing reports of crime and harassment
        around Minerva’s San Francisco residence hall </h1>
        <p>
        <em>By Emma Stiefel for <a href="https://www.minervaquest.com/">the Minerva
        Quest</a></em>
        </p>
        <p>
        <em>This piece is part one of a series about crime and safety around the 16 Turk
        Street Minerva residence hall. The second article in the series will explore
        Minerva administration and student responses to safety risks.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong><em>Trigger warning: this article discusses crime and street harassment
        and includes detailed descriptions of traumatic experiences.</em></strong>

    <div id=’introduction’ class='text'>
        <p>
        In 2019, the class of 2023 became the first Minerva students to live at the 16
        Turk Street residence hall. The building’s location on the edge of San
        Francisco’s Tenderloin neighborhood has consistently spurred conversations and
        concern about how the risk students face when they venture outside.
        </p>
        <p>
        Of the 59 Minerva students who responded to a Quest survey, 26 said 16 Turk was
        the least safe residence hall they’d lived in. Some students have tried to avoid
        living at 16 Turk Street and question why Minerva administrators would house
        students in the location at all. In light of these ongoing concerns, the Quest
        investigated the threat of crime around 16 Turk in comparison to the two other
        residence halls Minerva has used in San Francisco.
        </p>
        <p>
        Our investigation revealed that the area surrounding 16 Turk are significantly
        less safe compared to previous Minerva residence halls in almost every way. More
        incidents are reported by the general public in the area and a greater
        proportion of crimes reported are violent. Minerva students report experiencing
        crimes and harassment more often when living here, and most students feel at
        risk in the area.
        </p>
        <p>
        This might seem like a foregone conclusion to anyone familiar with the area
        around 16 Turk. As someone who’s lived in 16 Turk since the fall, I certainly
        wasn’t shocked by most of the statistics this piece includes.
        </p>
        <p>
        But it’s important to understand the extent to which verifiable risk and
        experience of crime overlap with perceptions of safety. It’s also important to
        quantitatively compare 16 Turk to the other residence halls Minerva has used to
        understand just how much more dangerous it really is. That’s what this article
        does — keep reading to learn about the specifics I found.
        </p>
        <p>
        This data journalism article is the first in a two-part series on this subject.
        The second article will explore how Minerva administrators and the student
        community have responded to the safety risks discussed below.
        </p>
        </div>
    <div id=’crime_general’ class='text'>
        <h2>More crime is reported around 16 Turk in general</h2>
        <p>
        According to <a
        href="https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-2018-to-Present/wg3w-h783">San
        Francisco Police Department incident report data</a>, an average of
        approximately 15.9 incidents per day were reported within a 300 meter radius of
        16 Turk in 2019. Coordinates for each incident report are only mapped to the
        nearest intersection, not the precise location of the crime. See the Methodology
        section for more details on the location data available and how I defined
        proximity to a location.
        </p>
        <div id='total_map' class='viz map'></div>
        <p>
        <em>The above map displays the total crimes reported near each San Francisco
        intersection in 2019. The larger and darker the circle over an intersection is,
        the more crimes were reported near there. Click on an intersection to see
        exactly how many crimes were reported near there in 2019. </em>
        </p>
        <p>
        The amount of crime reported with a 300 meter radius of 16 Turk is over 3 times
        higher than the rate for both the 851 California Street and 1412 Market Street
        residence halls Minerva has used in the past. Compared to the approximately 15.9
        crimes reported each day near 16 Turk, there were approximately 3.3 reported
        near 851 California Street and 4.3 reported near 1412 Market Street.
        </p>
        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart viz"
        data-src="visualisation/5620408"><script
        src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
        <p>
        What might surprise students — or at least surprised me, based on my own
        experiences living in 16 Turk and 851 California and visiting 1412 Market — is
        that crime is reported around 1412 Market at a rate closer to that of 851
        California than 16 Turk. 1412 Market and 16 Turk are both located in the
        Tenderloin, whereas 851 California is in the elevated Nob Hill neighborhood,
        which might suggest that 16 Turk and 1412 Market would have similarly high crime
        rates while 851 California has a uniquely low one.
        </p>
        <p>
        Without further research, it’s impossible to know why so many more incidents are
        reported near 16 Turk compared to 1412 Market. It may be the case that the
        underlying risk of crime is similar in both locations, but 16 Turk is in a
        busier area and therefore has more incidents. It may also be the case that 16
        Turk is actually significantly riskier. Most likely, some combination of these
        reasons is true.
        </p>
        </div>
    <div id=’violent_crime’ class='text'>
        <h2>Crime around 16 Turk is more likely to be violent</h2>
        <p>
        In addition to having higher general crime rates, the area around 16 Turk Street
        also has more reported incidents of <a
        href="https://nij.ojp.gov/topics/crimes/violent-crime">violent crime</a> —
        defined here as assault, robbery, homicide, rape, and sex offenses.

        </p>
        <p>
        As the chart below shows, 16 Turk Street has especially high rates of assault —
        it’s the second most common crime in the area. For students like me who live in
        the building and are used to hearing fights and the occasional gunshot from our
        rooms, this is hardly surprising. The most common crime near each residence hall
        is larceny and theft.

        <h2>Minerva students experience more crime around 16 Turk</h2>
        <p>
        The relative crime rates around each residence hall aligns with most students’
        perceptions of safety  — 16 Turk Street is more dangerous than 1412 Market
        Street, which is more dangerous than 851 California Street.
        </p>
        <div class="flourish-embed viz" data-src="story/801252"><script

        <p>
        Crimes reported by Minerva students on the Quest’s anonymous survey broadly
        reflect the general trends discussed above, though the sample size of 59
        respondents certainly does not fully account for student experiences. 16
        students told the Quest that they had been a victim of a crime in or near a
        Minerva residence hall. A majority (9) of those students reported that the crime
        occurred near 16 Turk. Consistent with general crime statistics, 1412 had the
        second highest number of crimes (5) reported near it. Crimes students reported
        included assault and threats of violence, theft, sexual harassment, and rape.
        </p>
        <div class="flourish-embed viz" data-src="story/802394"><script
        src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
        <p>
        Minerva has <a
        href="https://minervaschools.wufoo.com/forms/z12pw7gl1ukb8nr/">its own reporting
        forms</a> students can use to report safety incidents and, as a branch campus of
        Keck Graduate Institute, is legally required to publish crime data based on
        these forms and police calls for service in an <a
        href="https://minervaschools-production-cms-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/Annual_Security_Report_2019_-_2020_1.pdf">Annual
        Fire Safety and Security Report</a>. Minerva’s data, however, shows less
        incidents than have been reflected in Quest’s survey.
        </p>
        <p>
        The true rate at which Minerva students are the victims of crimes and street
        harassment is difficult to quantify. The Quest survey obviously doesn’t include
        the experiences of all students, yet it’s possible students were more likely to
        respond to the survey if they’d had problems on the street.
        </p>
        <p>
        Presented with Quest’s findings, Kayla Krupnick Walsh, Minerva’s Dean of
        Students, and Jason Lindo, Minerva’s San Francisco Director of Student Life &
        Operations, wrote that “The numbers that are quoted in your report do not match
        the numbers of reports that have been made to staff and therefore we once again
        encourage students who are the victims of crimes or concerned they may have been
        the victim of a crime to speak with their Community Manager or City Director as
        soon as possible so that we may support them and work toward longer term
        resolutions.”
        </p>
        <p>
        Several Minerva students told the Quest they haven’t reported incidents to
        Minerva because they didn’t think it would be worth the effort. One anonymous
        M’22 student described four separate incidents of assault and harassment in
        downtown San Francisco. She concluded her response by writing “None of these
        incidences were ever reported to Minerva building staff because I did not see
        what use they could be [and] found [it] to be a waste of time [and] effort [and]
        emotional expenditure on my part.”
        </p>
        <p>
        How students respond to crime and the ways Minerva has and has not supported
        them will be further discussed in the next article in this series. For the
        purposes of this data-driven report, I simply want to emphasize how difficult it
        is to comprehensively quantify a topic as sensitive and complex as crime and
        harassment.</p>
    </div>
    <div id=’street_harassment’ class='text'>
        
        <h2>Street Harassment is a harder to quantify but pervasive problem</h2>
        <p>
        Street harassment is especially difficult to understand through data alone. The
        crime data explored in the maps and charts above doesn’t fully reflect
        catcalling and other types of sexual harassment because, while <a
        href="https://stopstreetharassment.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SSH-KYR-California.pdf">some
        of these offenses are illegal under California law</a>, they tend to go
        unreported. But this type of harassment, however, significantly influences how
        safe students, especially women and female-presenting students, feel in a
        neighborhood.
        </p>
        <p>
        “What usually makes me feel safest is how often female members of the community
        experience altercations,” Ri Bouthiller, an M’20 alum who is nonbinary yet often
        perceived as a woman, told the Quest. “I felt really safe in Buenos Aires
        [because] nobody sexually harassed me. People got robbed at knifepoint in Buenos
        Aires, but I didn't feel unsafe because no locals were harassing me.”
        </p>
        <p>
        The issue of catcalling underscores how gendered experiences of safety are.
        Male-presenting students are generally more likely to say that they feel safe in
        a neighborhood and less likely to experience harassment and crime.
        Female-presenting students are more likely to feel unsafe in a neighborhood
        because of harassment, and many plan their daily routines to avoid times and
        locations they deem risky. These students are also more likely to be the victim
        of a crime or harassment, as the chart below shows.
        </p>
        <div class="flourish-embed viz" data-src="story/802382"><script
        src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
        <p>
        Though mentioned less frequently in survey responses and interviews, students
        also face racist and homophobic street harassment. Peleg Shilo, a male M’23
        student, told the Quest that he was called anti-gay slurs by an assailant in
        downtown San Francisco. He also noted that “I am not gay, nor do I believe I
        ‘look gay’.”
        </p>
        <p>
        Over the past year, Asian and Asian-presenting students have increasingly faced
        harassment and threats <a
        href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-03-16/anti-asian-hate-pandemic">due
        to racist rhetoric about the coronavirus pandemic exacerbating prejudice</a>.
        Nathan Torento, an M’21 student from the Philippines, told the Quest that street
        harassers have called him anti-Asian and anti-Chinese slurs, followed him, and
        threatened to kill him on multiple occasions in downtown San Francisco.
        </p>
        <p>
        It didn’t matter to harassers that Bouthiller is nonbinary, Shilo is not gay,
        and Torento is Filipino, not Chinese. Obviously, someone who chooses to yell
        slurs and threats at strangers isn’t going to correctly or fully grasp that
        person’s identity. Yet the discrepancy is worth emphasizing because while many
        students are aware of how they are perceived (correctly or not) by others, some
        may be the targets of harassment they don’t expect.
        </p>
        <p>
        While street harassment can significantly impact a students’ experience in a
        city, many students don’t report these incidents to Minerva or the police and
        struggle with determining when harassment is legally defined with a crime. Some
        respondents to the Quest’s anonymous survey struggled with whether to define
        sexual harassment like catcalling and being followed as crimes. Some students
        complained about repeated harassment but concluded it was not a crime, while a
        few reported these as crimes.
        </p>
        </div>
    <div id=’crime_context’ class='text'>
        <h2>Why are crime and harassment more common near 16 Turk?</h2>
        <p>
        The data explored above establish that the general public and Minerva students
        are more likely to report problems in the area surrounding 16 Turk Street. Yet
        my analysis doesn’t delve into the complex factors behind why the Tenderloin in
        general and the streets close to 16 Turk especially has elevated crime rates.
        </p>
        <p>
        The first explanation mentioned by many Minerva students and the administrators
        who responded to Quest’s questions for this article is “homelessness”. In my
        conversations with Minerva community members for this article and as a student
        in general, I’ve noticed that homelessness and crime risk are often used
        interchangeably.
        </p>
        <p>
        The crimes Minerva students described to the Quest provide anecdotal evidence
        that many incidents do involve individuals who appear homeless. It’s not hard to
        imagine why someone experiencing extreme poverty might be more likely to steal,
        or why someone with an untreated mental illness might behave unpredictably and
        sometimes violently.
        </p>
        <p>
        But carelessly associating homelessness with crime reinforces the stigma against
        this population. Many conversations amongst housed people neglect to address how
        <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24672998/">frequently homeless people
        experience violent crime</a> and reinforce efforts to criminalize homelessness
        and <a
        href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/We-don-t-want-to-be-outside-Homeless-say-14882625.php">move
        those living on the street out of sight without providing adequate services</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
        Many within the Minerva community will go out of their way to mention some of
        the broader societal forces behind homelessness and crime. In their response to
        the Quest, Krupnick Walsh and Lindo noted that “the impacts of the lack of an
        effective American social safety net and the systemic racism in America are
        evidenced on the streets of San Francisco.” Bouthiller told the Quest that while
        signs of poverty and desperation in an area make her feel less safe there, “it's
        not that I’m scared of homeless people, but homeless people are normally a
        symptom of a greater problem in the area that makes me feel like I shouldn’t
        trust police in that place.”
        </p>
        <p>
        The next article in this series will further discuss how Minerva students might
        help make the area around 16 Turk Street safer for everyone, including the
        homeless people who live there. I want to conclude this piece, however, by
        emphasizing that the data and student stories discussed here are the result of a
        societal failure to keep everyone, including and especially homeless people,
        safe.
        </p>

    <div id=’methodology’ class='text'>
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>
        General data about incidents reports that have been filed with the San Francisco
        Police Department are <a
        href="https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-2018-to-Present/wg3w-h783">available
        here</a>. The code used to analyze this data is <a
        href="https://github.com/emmastiefel/sf-res-crime-analysis">available here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
        The anonymous Quest survey used to collect student experiences with safety and
        crime is <a href="https://forms.gle/XCfvYAra9atDN6og7">available here</a>; the
        fully anonymized dataset is <a
        href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ecBN4mMFN4V5L5oLHaHn5cvOUJdM6FC2v4792OhCfYE/edit?usp=sharing">available
        here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
        Precise location data was generally not available. The San Francisco incident
        report data provides the nearest intersection rather than the specific location
        a report was made from. Students sometimes provided specific locations in their
        survey responses but mostly referenced a general area. Some instances of crime
        and harassment, including a perpetrator following a student to a residence hall,
        couldn’t be easily mapped to a specific location even if the data was available.
        </p>
        <p>
        An intersection was defined as near a residence hall if the distance between it
        and the residence was less than a given radius, based on latitude and longitude
        coordinates. The full code is available in the link above. I tested four
        different radii for defining proximity, and the average per-residence hall daily
        crime rates for each definition of proximity are included in the “Average daily
        incident reports near San Francisco residence halls” chart.
        </p>
        <p>
        Defining proximity using a fixed radius from a residence hall doesn’t fully
        reflect how students navigate and experience an area. The radius may include
        locations many students avoid — while living in 16 Turk Street, for example, I
        have never visited the Turk / Taylor Street and Eddy / Taylor Street
        intersections even though they are on the same block as the residence hall.
        </p>
        <p>
        I only used public incident report data from 2019 because of how the coronavirus
        pandemic impacted trends. Daily incident reports dropped sharply after the onset
        of the pandemic and implementation of public health measures in early 2020. I
        filtered out pandemic-era data because I want this analysis to generalize to the
        long-term future, during which incident report rates will presumably return to
