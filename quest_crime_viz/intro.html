    Understanding how safe a new neighborhood is has always been a part of the
    adjustment process for Minerva students moving through the global rotation.
    After arriving at a new residence hall, most students quickly decide what
    streets they would rather not risk exploring and how late is too late to venture
    outside.

    Recently, community conversations about safety have focused on San Francisco
    residence halls, where students across cohorts have ended up due to coronavirus
    travel restrictions. The 16 Turk Street residence hall, located on the edge of
    San Francisco’s Tenderloin neighborhood, has especially raised concerns.
    According to a Quest survey, 26 of 30 Minerva students who had lived at 16 Turk
    Street reported that it was the least safe residence hall they had lived in.
    Some students have tried to avoid living at 16 Turk Street and question why
    Minerva administrators would house students in the location at all.

    In light of these ongoing concerns, the Quest investigated how (un)safe Minerva
    residence halls and what exactly “safe” means. Our investigation focuses on San
    Francisco, the city where students spend the most time and the one that has
    resulted in the most safety complaints, but we’ll discuss other residence halls
    as well.

    Our investigation revealed that 16 Turk is significantly less safe than other
    Minerva residence halls in almost every way. More crimes are reported by the
    general public in the area, a greater proportion of those crimes are violent,
    more Minerva students report being the victim of crimes and harassment when
    living here, and most students feel at risk in the area.

    This might seem like a foregone conclusion to anyone familiar with the area
    around 16 Turk. But it’s important to understand the extent to which actual risk
    and experience of crime overlap with student perceptions of safety which, as we
    will see, can be influenced by stereotypes and biases as much as verifiable
    danger. It’s also important to quantitatively compare 16 Turk to the other
    residence halls Minerva has used in San Francisco and across the global rotation
    to understand just how unusually dangerous it really is. That’s what we’ve tried
    to accomplish with this article — keep reading to learn about the specifics we
    found.
