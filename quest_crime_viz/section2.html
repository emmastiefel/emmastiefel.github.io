<p>
Broadly, the relative crime rates around each residence hall reflects student
perceptions of safety  â€” 16 Turk Street is more dangerous than 1412 Market
Street, which is more dangerous than 851 California Street. 1412 and 851 are
actually much closer to each other and 16 turk is an outlier

<ul>
<li>This is somewhat surprising to me, at least - would have thought 1412 and 16
turk would be closer together, and 851 would be a low outlier
<ul>
<li>Because they are both in tenderloin, mostly on market, and students have
talked about both in similar ways tho most i think would agree 16 turk is worse
<li>I guess maybe it comes down to population density? Others have mentioned
that corporate hqs around 1412 also meant more security - can ask in interviews
i guess
