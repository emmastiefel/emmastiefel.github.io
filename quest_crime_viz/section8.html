<h3>How safe have Minerva students felt in other residence halls?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Will try to find other data sources about crime rates in other
cities/neighborhoods
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The Quest’s survey suggests that, for Minerva students, the other global
residence halls are much safer than San Francisco locations. Of 17 students who
told us they were victim of crime or harassment, 14 were near a San Francisco
res hall (9 of those near 16 Turk), 2 were in Buenos Aires, 1 was in Seoul. Note
that there are more locations reported than students who reported a crime
because a few students reported multiple crimes at different locations.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Seoul:
<ul>
<li>Students generally felt very safe
<li>One crime reported on our survey here: a sexual assault by another Minerva
student
<ul>
<li>Highlights danger students can oppose to each other, as opposed to our focus
on crimes originating from the external neighborhood
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<li>Hyderabad:
<ul>
<li>Some issues with harassment and theft but students didn’t report many
serious concerns
<li>Hotel security:
<ul>
<li>Some felt less safe because the main apartment doors did not lock and hotel
staff could come and go at any time
<li>Others felt more safe because of the security around the hotel, compared to
the lack of security at the Seoul Yongsan residence for instance
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<li>Berlin:
<ul>
<li>Some students felt safe because of locks on building and apartment unit
doors, yet burglary has been an issue in the past
<li>Some reported feeling unsafe because homeless people would enter the
apartment building and sleep in the stairwells
</li>
</ul>
<li>Buenos Aires:
<ul>
<li>Some problems with theft in the area
<li>Same hotel issues as Hyderabad: some felt less safe because of staff coming
and going, others felt more secure because of front desk guards
</li>
</ul>
<li>London:
<ul>
<li>Less data; generally seems to have been deemed safe by many students
</li>
</ul>
<li>Taipei:
<ul>
<li>Much less data, seems to have been generally safe in a crime sense
<li>But some students noted health and sanitation concerns, such as with black
mold in the residence hall
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Revisit point about bias and discomfort vs. safety
<ul>
<li>Buenos Aires and Hyderabad were sometimes made to seem more unsafe than they
actually are because they are in less developed countries
<ul>
<li>I remember some students being very concerned about theft and safety in
Buenos Aires and the local staff being somewhat frustrated that concerns were
blown out of proportion
<li>Something to ask about in interviews
